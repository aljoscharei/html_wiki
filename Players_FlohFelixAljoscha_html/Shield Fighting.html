<h1 >Shield Fighting</h1>
<p>If you make a successful melee attack roll you can use your bonus
action to slam a target within 5 ft with your shield. If the target is
your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw against 10
plus your Strength (Athletics) modifier. On a failure you can choose to
move the creature 10 feet in a line, or cause it to become prone <a

<h1 >Can you
break up your Attack action for a bonus action?</h1>
<p>https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/72888/can-you-break-up-your-attack-action-for-a-bonus-action
You can do it to move:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you
can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks.
For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack
feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an
attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again. (PHB 190)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be necessary for the Great Weapon Master feat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or
reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee
weapon attack as a bonus action</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a level 17 Fighter, if I cannot place a bonus action between
attacks, there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I have to wait until I finished all 4 attacks of the action, to make
another attack as a bonus action</li>
<li>the bonus action attack is wasted unless the kill or crit happens on
the 4th attack</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So can I take a bonus action in the middle of the attacks of
an action?</strong></p>
<h2 >The language is unclear</h2>
<h2
>The
intent may have been that you must wait for your Action to complete
before utilizing your Bonus Action.</h2>
<p>Jeremy Crawford had <a
href="https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/557816721810403329">previously
tweeted</a> that Bonus Action timing was completely up to the player
regardless of the trigger requirement. While this gave a lot of freedom
of choice, it wasn’t really fully in tune with the written rules on <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#YourTurn">Bonus
Action timing</a> (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn,
<strong>unless the bonus action’s timing is specified</strong>…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that tweet has been <a
href="https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/994993596989300736">updated</a>
after realizing his mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clarification about bonus actions: if a feature says you can do X as
a bonus action if you do Y, you must do Y before you can do X. For
Shield Master, that means the bonus action must come after the Attack
action. You decide when it happens afterward that turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further clarified with <a
href="https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/995024061267767298">this
tweet</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No general rule allows you to insert a bonus action between attacks
in a single action. You can interrupt a multiple-attack action with a
bonus action/reaction only if the trigger of the bonus action/reaction
is an attack, rather than the action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that clarification was…wait for it…<a
href="https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/995134313841676288">further
clarified again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My tweet below was addressing bonus actions and reactions that have
triggers. A bonus action that has no trigger—such as Cunning Action and
the misty step spell—can take place whenever you want on your turn (PH,
189)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 >The RAW and the Crawford</h2>
<p>It seems clear that Crawford’s intent for Bonus Action triggers is
that there is a requirement for the triggering Action to fully complete
before you can take the Bonus Action. If you go by this, then you are
not able to take your Bonus Action inside of (interrupting) your Attack
Action.</p>
<h2 >A question of wording</h2>
<p>However, as stated above, GWM is not triggered by the completion of
an Action, but by the killing of or reducing an enemy to 0 HP. Given
that the trigger is not based on the Attack Action but on the result of
a hit combined with the rule on choosing when to take a bonus action
during your turn, then it seems possible to interrupt your Action.</p>
<h2 >Which way to go?</h2>
<p>I understand what Crawford is saying in that Actions are complete
events that can not be interrupted…except by movement. His clarification
that you can’t interrupt one action (Attack) with another (Bonus Action)
makes some sense, but given the precedent of allowing movement inside of
an Action and that the trigger for GWM is not the Action but an event, a
GM could rule at their table to allow it.</p>
<p>Crawford’s intent here is understandable, but it still doesn’t make
100% logical sense given that you can already interrupt your action with
movement and/or reactions.</p>
<p>At my table, I generally let my players shift and shuffle actions as
long as they aren’t actually limited by a clear mechanic. In this case,
it makes more than good sense to allow the player this and I haven’t
seen any issues with it at my tables.</p>
