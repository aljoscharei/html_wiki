<h1 >Banishment</h1>
<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an item distasteful to the
target)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to
another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw or be banished. If the target is native to the plane of existence
you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there,
the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell
ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the
nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br />
If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one
you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning
to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the
target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space
if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When your cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 4th.</p>
