<ul>
<li>When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the
spellâ€™s range is doubled.</li>

cover</a> and <a

cover</a>.</li>
<li>You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the
cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell

cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.</li>
