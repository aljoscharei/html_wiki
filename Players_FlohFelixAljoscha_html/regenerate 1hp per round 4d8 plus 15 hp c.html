<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy

<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The
target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the
target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit
points each minute).<br />
The targetâ€™s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if
any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold
it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to
the stump.</p>
