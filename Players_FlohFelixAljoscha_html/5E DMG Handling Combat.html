<h1 >5E DMG Handling Combat</h1>
<p>This section builds on the <a href="5e%20Rules%20Combat.html">5e Rules
Combat</a> rules and offers tips for keeping the game running smoothly
when a fight breaks out.</p>
<h3 >Tracking Initiative</h3>
<p>You can use several different methods for keeping track of who goes
when in combat.</p>
<h4 >Hidden List</h4>
<p>Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players can’t see:
usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet
computer. This method allows you to keep track of combatants who haven’t
been revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place to
record the current hit points of monsters, as well as other useful
notes.</p>
<p>A downside of this approach is that you have to remind the players
round after round when their turns come up.</p>
<h4 >Visible List</h4>
<p>You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the players tell you
their initiative numbers, write them on the whiteboard in order from
highest to lowest, leaving space between each name. Either write the
monsters’ initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the
list on each monster’s first turn.</p>
<p>As a further improvement, use magnets that you can attach to a
metal-based whiteboard with characters’ and monsters’ names written on
them, or write those names on cards held in place by magnets.</p>
<p>A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. Players know when
their turns are coming up, and they can start planning their actions in
advance. A visible list also removes any uncertainty about when the
monsters will act in the fight.</p>
<p>A variation on the visible list is to give one player responsibility
for keeping track of initiative, either on a whiteboard or on a piece of
paper the other players can see. This method reduces the number of
things you need to keep track of yourself.</p>
<h4 >Index Cards</h4>
<p>In this approach, each character gets an index card, as does each
group of identical monsters. When the players tell you their initiative
numbers, write the numbers on their characters’ index cards. Do the same
when you roll the monsters’ initiative. Then arrange the cards in order
from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move down through the
stack. When you call out the name of the character whose turn it is,
also mention who’s next, prompting that player to start thinking ahead.
After each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is moved to
the bottom of the stack.</p>
<p>At first, players don’t know the order of play when you use combat
cards, and they don’t know where the monsters fall into the order until
the monsters act.</p>
<h3 >Tracking Monster Hit Points</h3>
<p>During a combat encounter, you need to track how much damage each
monster takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so that their players
don’t know how many hit points a monster has remaining. Whether you
choose to be secretive or not is up to you. What’s important is that
every monster’s hit points be tracked individually.</p>
<p>Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn’t onerous, but it helps
to have a system for larger groups of monsters. If you aren’t using
miniatures or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track of your
monsters is to assign them unique features. Descriptions such as
“the ogre with the nasty scar” and “the ogre with the horned helm” help
you and your players track which monster is which. For example, imagine
that you’re running an encounter with three ogres, each of which has 59
hit points. Once initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre’s hit points
and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each
one:</p>
<p>Krag (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre">ogre</a> w/ scar):
59</p>
<p>Thod (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre">ogre</a> w/ helm):
59</p>
<p>Mur (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre">ogre</a> who smells
like poo): 59</p>
<p>Krag ([ogre](: 59</p>
<p>Thod ([ogre](: 59</p>
<p>Mur ([ogre](: 59</p>
<p>If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one easy way to
differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use
identical miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the
miniatures with small stickers of different colors or stickers with
different letters or numbers on them.</p>
<p>For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, you could use
three identical ogre miniatures tagged with stickers marked A, B, and C,
respectively. To track the ogres’ hit points, you can sort them by
letter, then subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. Your
records might look something like this after a few rounds of combat:</p>
<p>[Ogre]( A: <sub>59</sub> <sub>53</sub> <sub>45</sub> <sub>24</sub>
<sub>14</sub> <sub>9</sub> dead</p>
<p>[Ogre]( B: <sub>59</sub> <sub>51</sub> 30</p>
<p>[Ogre]( C: 59</p>
<p>Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don’t ever feel as though
you need to reveal exact hit points, <strong>but if a monster is below
half its hit point maximum, it’s fair to say that it has visible wounds
and appears beaten down</strong>. You can describe a monster taken to
half its hit points as bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress
in a fight against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when to use
their most powerful spells and abilities.</p>
<h3 >Using and Tracking
Conditions</h3>
<p>Various rules and features in the game are clear about when they
apply a condition to a creature. You can also apply conditions on the
fly. They’re meant to be intuitive for you to do so. For example, if a
character is in a state, such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you
can say the character is unconscious <a
href="202202102013%205e%20Conditions%20Unconscious.html">202202102013 5e
Conditions Unconscious</a></p>
<p>Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. For monsters, it’s
often easiest to track conditions on combat cards or wherever you track
initiative. Players should remember any conditions affecting their
characters. Because players have incentive to forget or overlook
hampering conditions, character conditions can also be marked on combat
cards or a whiteboard.</p>
<p>You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on hand, marked
with conditions and their effects. Then hand the cards to players as the
conditions come up. Having a bright pink index card on top of a
character sheet can help even the most absentminded player remember the
effects of being charmed <a

Conditions Charmed</a> STICKES WITH COPYPASTED TEXT</p>
<h3 >Monsters and Critical Hits</h3>
<p>A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as a player
character. That said, if you use a monster’s average damage, rather than
rolling, you might wonder how to handle a critical hit. When the monster
scores a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with the hit
and add them to the average damage. For example, if a goblin normally
deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it
deals 5 + 1d6 slashing damage.</p>

<h3 >Using Miniatures</h3>

<h3 >Adjudicating Reaction Timing</h3>
<p>Typical combatants rely on the <a
href="5e%20Opportunity%20Attacks.html">5e Opportunity Attacks</a> and the
<a
href="202202101907%205e%20Actions%20in%20Combat%20Ready.html">202202101907
5e Actions in Combat Ready</a> action for most of their reactions in a
fight. Various spells and features give a creature more reaction
options, and sometimes the timing of a reaction can be difficult to
adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified
in the reaction’s description. For example, the opportunity Attack <a
href="5e%20Opportunity%20Attacks.html">5e Opportunity Attacks</a> and the
<a href="shield%20w">shield w</a> Shield spell are clear about the fact
that they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing
specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its
trigger finishes, as in the Ready action <a
href="202202101907%205e%20Actions%20in%20Combat%20Ready.html">202202101907
5e Actions in Combat Ready</a>.</p>
<h3 >Combining Game Effects</h3>
<p>Different game features can affect a target at the same time. But
when two or more game features have the same name, only the effects of
one of them—the most potent one—apply while the durations of the effects
overlap. For example, if a target is ignited by a fire elemental’s Fire
Form trait, the ongoing fire damage doesn’t increase if the burning
target is subjected to that trait again. Game features include spells,
class features, feats, racial traits, monster abilities, and magic
items. See the related rule in the “Combining Magical Effects” <a
