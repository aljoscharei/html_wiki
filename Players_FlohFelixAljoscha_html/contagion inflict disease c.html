<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />

<p>Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a
disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.<br />
At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution
saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s
effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these
saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature
recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.<br />
Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect
that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects
apply to it.<br />

its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom

damage.<br />
<strong>Mindfire.</strong> The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The

throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the
<strong><em>confusion</em></strong> spell during combat.<br />
<strong>Seizure.</strong> The creature is overcome with shaking. The
