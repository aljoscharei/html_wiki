<h1 >5e Difficult Terrain</h1>
<p>in Combat: Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless
plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous
staircases–the setting of a typical fight contains difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This
rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow
bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,
whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Travelling: The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume
relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon
corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps,
rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice covered ground–all
considered difficult terrain.</p>
<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain–moving 1 foot in
difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed–so you can cover only half the
normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
