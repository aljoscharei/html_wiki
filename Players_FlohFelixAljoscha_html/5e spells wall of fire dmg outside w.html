man-sized creatures will take 8 points of damage, while units of large

<p>An immobile, opaque, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire
springs into existence. The wall can be as large as 1,200 square feet,
and may be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster
desires, so that it can be a straight wall or curved into a protective
circle. This wall of flames is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than
4 HD. Monsters with more than 4 HD suffer 1d6 points of damage when they
pass through the wall. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures
or creatures who use cold or are accustomed to cold. The wall may not be
evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are.</p>
