<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Soulmate</h1>
<p>You have a soulmate, either in the romantic or familial sense.
Irrespective of which, you may telepathically communicate simple
messages and feelings to your counterpart. You al- ways know
approximately where the other person is and if they are in any kind of
trouble. The counterpart may be a non-player character important to the
game or the character of another player; talk to your gaming friends and
decide what is best. In the latter case, it is enough that one of the
characters acquires the boon in question. If the soulmate perishes then
after a period of grieving you can gain +2 to an ability score of your
choice as you redirect your energies.</p>
