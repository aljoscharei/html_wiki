<h1 >Combat Speciality</h1>
<p>At 6th level, your intense dedication to your weapon training shows
itself with a new feature:<br />
- For Sword Saints, you can use your reaction after taking damage from a
melee attack to make a single attack roll against that attacker with
your sword if the attacker is in reach. - For Axe Artists, when you
succeed at your first attack roll you can use your reaction to gain
advantage on your second attack roll. - For Spear Dancers as long as you
wield only your spear, you have a +1 bonus to AC. - For Flailers, when
an attacker fails on their attack roll, you can use your reaction to
ensnare their weapon. Make an opposed Strength check, if you succeed the
attacker is disarmed.</p>
