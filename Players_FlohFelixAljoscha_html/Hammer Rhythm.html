<h1 >Hammer Rhythm</h1>
<p>As a weapon, the hammer is ancient and its brutal simplicity may in
the right hands pound forth a deadly rhythm echoing over the
battlefield. You are one of those who, through training and experience,
can utilize the force of the hammer, whether in its single-handed or
heavy version.</p>
<p>At 6th level you can crush the enemy’s shield with the hammer. After
a failed attack roll where the opponent defends with a shield, you may
use your bonus action to roll a Strength check against the target’s
Armor Class. If successful, a wooden shield shatters to splinters while
a metal shield is torn from the opponent’s arm and dropped. The shield
carrier also suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the heavy blow.</p>
<p>At 13th level you can use your hammer to shove your opponent. After a
failed attack roll, you can use your reaction to grip the hammer with
both hands and use it to ram the enemy. Make an opposed Strength check
with the target. On a success, you can either move the target 5 feet or
make them prone. On a failure you and the target remain where you
are.</p>
