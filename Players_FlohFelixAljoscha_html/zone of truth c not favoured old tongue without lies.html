<h1 >Zone of Truth</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a
15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.
Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the
first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie
while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on
its saving throw.<br />
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering
questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature
can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the
boundaries of the truth.</p>
<p>MAYBE THE INTERROGATION IS CONDUCTED IN A LANGUAGE IN WHICH LIES ARE
IMPOSSIBLE LIKE DRAGON IN EARTH SEA</p>
