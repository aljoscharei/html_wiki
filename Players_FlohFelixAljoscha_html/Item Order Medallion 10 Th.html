<h1 >Item Order Medallion 10 Th</h1>
<p>The medallions of Ordo Magica are giv- en to novices and stay with
the wizards for their entire career. When the wizard reaches adept (3rd)
level, the medallion transforms to symbolize this step; the same thing
happens when reaching master (11th) level. Some chapters have made the
order medallion mandatory and have also bound certain functions to it,
such as the abil- ity to open doors which are closed to
outsiders/novices/ adepts and to activate the chapterâ€™s magic
circle.</p>
