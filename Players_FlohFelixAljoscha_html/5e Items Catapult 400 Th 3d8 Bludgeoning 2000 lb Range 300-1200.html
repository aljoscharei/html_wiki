Items Catapult 400 Th 3d8 Bludgeoning 2000 lb Range 300-1200</h1>
<p>Symbaroum: Catapult. Ballistic devices have long been employed in
Alberetorâ€™s many wars, and most frequently used, then and now, is the
catapult. Compared to its bigger cousin, the trebuchet, it is relatively
easy to transport but still very effective against both structures and
troops. It takes someone proficient with siege weapons to load, aim and
fire a catapult; it can be loaded with boulders or with breaching pots,
the former crushing buildings and the latter more effective against
weaker but flammable targets, including hostile troop formations on the
field of battle.</p>
