and the barbarians here in the north, there is no shortage of refugees
in these lands. Forced to leave your traditional home, you are still in

you have and what you can acquire.</p>

</ul>
<p>Personality 1. I am just happy to be alive. 2. I can’t seem to get a
fair shake and will do what I need to survive. 3. When I get drunk I cry
and sing sad songs from the old country. 4. I sometimes get lost in the
pleasures of this place. 5. I did not ask to come here; I will not live
by your dumb rituals. 6. I want to learn as much as I can to fit in and
be prosperous. 7. I often point out that I am not like most of these
other refugees. 8. I speak of going back and setting things
straight.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Family. Now more than ever it is important to remember that
blood is what unites us. Strangers cannot be trusted. 2. Opportunity.
Some harp on about the past and miss the fantastic opportunities given
here. 3. Survival. We left the old rules back there, and the laws of
this place are not mine. I do what I must to make it. 4. Tradition. The
preservation of our old way of life is what will save us. 5. Generosity.
It’s important to give to those who have less, even if we have little.
6. The Chosen People. My tribe is chosen by the gods, and right now
tested by them. We will prevail, and become who we are meant to be.</p>
<p>Bond 1. The first person I met here was really nice to me. I will
never forget. 2. My weapon is an heirloom, and using it feels like
honoring those that made it. 3. There is this organization that helped
me and my family when we first came. I want to do something for them in
return. 4. I have this piece of jewelry from back home, and I will not
part with it. 5. I betrayed some people when we fled, to get my family
out. I am pretty sure I saw one of them here. 6. Someone dear to me died
back there, and I want to give that person a proper burial.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I feel out of place here, and fear I would feel the same back
home too. 2. I sometimes drink to forget. 3. I blame my bad habits on
the past, which stops me from changing them. 4. I have nightmares about
what happened when we escaped. 5. I feel guilt for surviving when so
many others did not. I take silly risks to somehow make up for it. 6. If
someone insults my lost home I get really angry. Not sure why, it was
pretty bad and that’s why we left.</p>
