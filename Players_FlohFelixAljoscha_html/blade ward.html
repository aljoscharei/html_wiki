<p>You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until
the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.</p>
<p>useless I’m going to let you in on a secret, dear reader. Something
dark and mysterious that Dungeons and Dragons DMs don’t want you to
know. There is a mythical action, any character can take; an action that
imposes disadvantage on ALL attack rolls made against you, plus it
grants you advantage on ALL Dexterity saving throws you make for a whole
round. It’s a little known tool in everyone’s belt called the Dodge
action. You don’t need to be a special class or race; you, yes you, can
simply say “I take the Dodge action” and BAM! You do it!</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could spend one of your precious cantrip slots on
Blade Ward. Blade Ward lets you spend an action to lessen incoming
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Now, let’s quickly compare
the thing every character can do for free, and the thing you have to
spend a learned cantrip on!</p>
<p>Imposing disadvantage on attack rolls gives you more instances where
you take ZERO damage, and it doesn’t care what kind of attack is made.
Getting shot with an arrow? Dodge helps! Getting fried by a <a

Ray</a>? Dodge helps! Not only does it empower your defenses against all
forms of attack rolls, you also get bonuses on Dexterity saving throws.
Alternatively, with Blade Ward, you can halve incoming damage from
specifically three damage types. For this to be worth it, you would need
to be getting hit had you not imposed disadvantage, and care about the
difference in damage. If you’re a low level character who is already
injured, Blade Ward does functionally nothing. Half of 14 damage still
probably kills you in one hit. Dodge, on the other hand, gives you a
chance to not die.</p>
<p>All of this is to point and say dodging is slightly better than Blade
Ward in most cases. If you are likely getting hit regardless of imposing
the disadvantage, halving the damage at higher levels can be slightly
better, but then I must ask you: Why, in such a precarious predicament,
are you opting to cast a CANTRIP that does so little still? How many
cases are you going to end up in where you’ll just need to stick it out
in place and take a beating when you can Disengage and run, attempt to
Dash away, or, you know, cast a real spell that can teleport you, give
you the power of flight, or obliterate the things trying to kill
you?</p>
<p>There are just so few instances where any character will meaningfully
gain something from Blade Ward. It is without a doubt one of the worst
cantrips you could consider. Don’t go near it. Take utility cantrips,
take <a

heck, take <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/resistance">Resistance</a>.
Sure, both are bad, but at least you can reasonably prepare Resistance
before a trap. Just don’t waste your time with Blade Ward.</p>
