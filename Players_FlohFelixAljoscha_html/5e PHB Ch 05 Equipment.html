<h1 >5e PHB Ch 05 Equipment</h1>
<h1 >Chapter 5: Equipment</h1>
<p>The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many
sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome
jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn
from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost
anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and
luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.</p>
<p>For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks,
rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper
equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or
the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic
merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the
threats that the worlds of D&amp;D present.</p>

Equipment</h2>
<p>When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a
combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start
with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items
from the lists in this chapter. See the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#StartingWealthbyClass">Starting
Wealth by Class</a> table to determine how much gold you have to
spend.</p>
<p>You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It
might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased
during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a
weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might
even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed
down from generation to generation until your character finally took up
the mantle and followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.</p>

<p>Wealth appears in many forms in a D&amp;D world. Coins, gemstones,
trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your
character’s financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in
goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and
cheese.</p>
<p>Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the
rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold
by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and
those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in
coins.</p>

<p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the
relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most
common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the
copper piece (cp).</p>
<p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good
rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one
gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for
wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants
discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands
of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of
individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value,
and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable
goods.</p>
<p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin
among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a
flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.</p>
<p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among
laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a
piece of chalk.</p>
<p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes
appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum
piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they
sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An
electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is
worth ten gold pieces.</p>
<p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins
weigh a pound.</p>

Treasure</h3>
<p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and
more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures
and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided
that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.</em></strong> As a
general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half
their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are
rarely in good enough condition to sell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Items.</em></strong> Selling magic items is
problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard,
but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles.
Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come
across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.</em></strong> These items
retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade
them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For
exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a
buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trade Goods.</em></strong> On the borderlands, many
people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects,
trade goods — bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on — retain
their full value in the market and can be used as currency.</p>
