<h1 >Relentless</h1>
<p>At 13th level, your wrath can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re in a wrathful fury and
don’t die outright, you can make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw. If
you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this
feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short
or longer rest, the DC resets to 5.</p>
