This spell creates a missile of fire that affects one unit within 12
hexes. The damage from a fireball is equal to the caster’s level. Damage
is doubled against cavalry units, behemoth cavalry units, or chariot
units. If the unit makes a successful saving throw versus Blast, damage
is reduced to half. A unit may never lose more than 1/8 its maximum uhp
(rounded up) from a fireball.</p>

<p>This spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low
roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every
creature within a spherical volume having a 20’ diameter. A saving throw
versus Blast for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no
pressure.</p>
<p>The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and
height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead
streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material
body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms
into the fireball at that point. An early impact results in an early
detonation. If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow
passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile
attack throw (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the
bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.</p>
<p>The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the
area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold,
copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing
barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond
the barrier in order to attain its full volume.</p>
