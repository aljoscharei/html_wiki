<h1 >Ruins Scoundrel Approach Spy</h1>
<p>Already during The Great War there were secret agents working for the
King and the court in Alberetor. After the war, the agency lay dormant
until the recent troubling times made Queen Korinthia breathe life into
what is called the Royal Sekretorium.</p>
<p>The Sekretorium consists of a number of reliable nobles who secretly
enforce the Queen’s command to infiltrate various operations and hunt
for sensitive information – or spread disinformation. The committee is
led by high-borns, while the field work is carried out by nobles of
lower rank. A vital part of the operations is aimed at Korinthia’s own
allies within the Sun Church, Ordo Magica, the military and also the
duchies of the realm, meaning the Queen’s close relatives. Some Spies
are not equipped to handle the intrigues and moral ambiguities; others
are cast out in the cold after incriminating failures. Former Spies of
the Queen often live short lives, constantly on the run from both
enemies and their former superiors.</p>
<p>Some other organizations surely have a few spies placed in Ambria,
causing many people to be suspicious of converted barbarians,
changelings, abducted humans who have returned, and other strangers.</p>
