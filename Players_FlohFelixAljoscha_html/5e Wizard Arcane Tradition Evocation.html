<h3 >School of Evocation</h3>
<hr />
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects
such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling
lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own
gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<h4 >Evocation Savant</h4>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h4 >Sculpt Spells</h4>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety
within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation
spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a
number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they
take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
save.</p>
<h4 >Potent Cantrip</h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures
that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<h4 >Empowered Evocation</h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to
one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
<h4 >Overchannel</h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler
spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals
damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.<br />
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this
feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic
damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each
time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores
resistance and immunity.</p>
