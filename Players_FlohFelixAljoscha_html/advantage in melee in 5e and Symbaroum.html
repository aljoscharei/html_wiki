<h1 >advantage in melee in 5e

disadvantage</a></p>
<p>Advantage</p>
<p>not like 5e: If a character has the advantage, it receives a +2 bonus
to the relevant attribute when making Success tests, and its attacks
deal +1D4 extra damage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacking an unaware, surprised target.</li>
<li>All melee attacks against an enemy lying down.</li>
<li>All melee attacks against a flanked enemy. A target is considered
flanked if two enemies stand on opposite sides of it. It usually takes a
Movement Action to get around an enemy and flank it. In the same way a
cha- racter can use a Movement Action to get away from a flanked
position – but with the consequence of receiving a Free Attack from each
ene- my engaged in melee.</li>
<li>All attacks against enemies standing on lower ground than the
attacker, such as attacking down from a wall against enemies climbing a
ladder. This applies to both melee and ranged attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best ways to get advantage in Combat in 5e</p>
<ul>
<li>rogues: hiding (as they can hide as bonus action)</li>
<li>barbarians: reckless attack (it’s a bread-and-butter class
feature)</li>
<li>arcane spellcasters: faerie fire (a simple, low level,
underestimated spell)</li>
<li>warlock: darkness + devil sight (this blocks field of view for party
members though)</li>
<li>wizard / magic initiate feat: find familiar, having your familiar do
the help action.</li>
</ul>
