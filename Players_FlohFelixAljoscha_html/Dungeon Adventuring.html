<h1 >Dungeon Adventuring</h1>
<p>https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Dungeon_Adventuring</p>
<h2 >Sequence of Play Per Turn</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Wandering monsters:</strong> The referee makes checks as
applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Actions:</strong> The party decides what action to take
(e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms).</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The referee describes what happens. If
monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in
<em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Encounters"
title="Encounters">Encounters</a></strong></em>.</li>
<li><strong>End of turn:</strong> The referee updates time records, with
special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party’s
need to rest.</li>
</ol>
<h2 >Doors</h2>
<p>Dungeons often have many doors, some secret and others obvious. Many
are locked and many are stuck.</p>
<h3 >Searching for Secret Doors</h3>
<p>Some doors are hidden or concealed. Adventurers may choose to search
a 10’ × 10’ area for secret doors. See <em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Dungeon_Adventuring#Searching">#Searching</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chance of finding:</strong> If a character is searching in
the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a secret door.
(Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance.)</p>
<h3 >Stuck Doors</h3>
<p><strong>Forcing:</strong> The chance of forcing open a stuck door
depends on the character’s Strength (see <em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Ability_Scores"
title="Ability Scores">Ability Scores</a></strong></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Surprise:</strong> A failed attempt to force open a door
eliminates any possibility of surprise (see <em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Encounters"
title="Encounters">Encounters</a></strong></em>) that the party may have
against any monsters on the other side of the door.</p>
<h3 >Locked Doors</h3>
<p>Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or
opened by magic.</p>
<h3 >Doors Swinging Shut</h3>
<p>Doors opened by adventurers (by whatever means) are likely to swing
shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using iron
spikes or other wedges.</p>
<h3 >Monsters and Doors</h3>
<p>Monsters that live in the dungeon can usually open doors (even stuck
doors), unless they are blocked, magically closed, or wedged shut with
spikes.</p>
<h3 >Listening at Doors</h3>
<p><strong>Chance of success:</strong> PCs have a 1-in-6 chance of
detecting subtle sounds beyond a door. (Some <a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Character_Classes"
title="Character Classes">types of adventurers</a> may have an increased
chance of success.)</p>
<p><strong>Referee rolls:</strong> The referee should always roll for
the character listening so that the player never knows if the roll
failed or if there simply is no sound behind the door.</p>
<p><strong>One chance:</strong> This attempt may only be made one time
at any door by a character.</p>
<p><strong>Silent monsters:</strong> Some monsters, such as <a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Category:Undead"
title="Category:Undead">undead</a>, do not make any noise.</p>
<h2 >Movement</h2>
<p><strong>Exploring the unknown:</strong> When exploring unknown areas
of a dungeon, characters can move their <em><strong>base movement rate
in feet per turn</strong></em>. This (very slow!) rate of movement takes
account for the fact that PCs are exploring, watching their footing,
mapping, and trying to be quiet and avoid obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>In familiar areas:</strong> When PCs are moving through
dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the referee may allow them
to move at a faster rate. For example, the referee might allow PCs to
move at three times their base movement rate per turn, when moving
through familiar areas.</p>
<h2 >Resting</h2>
<p><strong>Frequency of rest:</strong> Characters must rest for one turn
every hour in the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong>Penalty for not resting:</strong> If characters press on
without resting, they suffer a penalty of –1 to hit and damage rolls
until they have rested for one turn.</p>
<h2 >Searching</h2>
<p>The following stipulations apply to searching for secret doors, room
traps, and treasure traps.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Searching takes one turn.</p>
<p><strong>Referee rolls:</strong> The referee should always roll for
the character searching, so that the player does not know if the roll
failed or if there are simply no hidden features present.</p>
<p><strong>One chance:</strong> Each character can only make one attempt
to search a specific area or item.</p>
<h2 >Traps</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of traps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Room traps:</strong> Large traps that are designed to affect
anyone who enters a certain area (e.g. a pit that opens in the floor
when walked over).</li>
<li><strong>Treasure traps:</strong> Small traps placed on an item, to
prevent it being tampered with or stolen (e.g. a poison needle on a
chest or lock).</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Triggering Traps</h3>
<p>Each trap is triggered by a specific action (e.g. opening a door or
walking over a particular area).</p>
<p><strong>Chance of triggering:</strong> Every time a character makes
an action that could trigger a trap, there is a 2-in-6 chance of the
trap being sprung.</p>
<p><strong>Trap damage:</strong> Damage inflicted by a triggered trap is
usually automatic, without an attack roll.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> Monsters may be able to bypass traps
without risk, if the referee wishes.</p>
<h3 >Searching for Room Traps</h3>
<p>Adventurers may choose to search a 10’ × 10’ area for room traps. If
the search succeeds, the trap is discovered. See <em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Dungeon_Adventuring#Searching">#Searching</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chance of finding:</strong> If a character is searching in
the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a room trap.
(Some <a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Character_Classes"
title="Character Classes">types of adventurers</a> may have an increased
chance.)</p>
<h3 >Searching for Treasure Traps</h3>
<p>Characters with the ability to find treasure traps (as noted in their
<a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Character_Classes"
title="Character Classes">class description</a>) may choose to search
items (e.g. chests, locks) for traps. See <em><strong><a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Dungeon_Adventuring#Searching">#Searching</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chance of finding:</strong> The chance of finding treasure
traps, if a character is searching in the right location, is noted in
the <a
href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Character_Classes"
title="Character Classes">character’s class</a> description.</p>
<h2 >Wandering Monsters</h2>
<p><strong>Frequency:</strong> A check is typically rolled once every
two turns in the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong>Chance:</strong> The typical chance of encountering a
wandering monster is 1-in-6.</p>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 ×
10 feet away, moving in the direction of the party.</p>
