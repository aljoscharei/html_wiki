<p>A cauldron is an iron pot suspended so that it can be tipped easily,
spilling its contents. Once emptied, a cauldron must be refilled — and
its contents must usually be reheated — before it can be used again. It
takes three actions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it.</p>
<p>Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as acid or green
slime, with different effects.</p>
<p>Boiling Oil. The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a 10-foot-square
area directly below it. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
