<h1 >turned undead</h1>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. - It also can’t take reactions. - For its action, it can
use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents
it from moving. - If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the
Dodge action.</p>
