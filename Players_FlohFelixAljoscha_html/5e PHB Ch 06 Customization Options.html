<h2 >Chapter 6: Customization
Options</h2>
<p>The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background
defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal
details you create set your character apart from every other character.
Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your
character can do. But this chapter is for players who — with the DM’s
permission — want to go a step further.</p>
<p>This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your
character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine
classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead
of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides
whether these options are available in a campaign.</p>
