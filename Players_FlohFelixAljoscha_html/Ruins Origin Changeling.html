<h1 >Ruins Origin Changeling</h1>
<p>that the eLves sometimes steal a human child from its crib and place
a changeling in its stead has been known amongst the barbarians for as
long as the witches can remember. Since the arrival of the Ambrians,
changelings have started to emerge among them as well. While a rare
occurrence, it is still a traumatic experience for every family
affected. It is unknown what exact purpose the elves have for doing
this, but Ordo Magica’s catalog of known cases in Ambria implies that
children have been taken throughout the entire population, literally
from both high and low.</p>
<p>A changeling looks human during childhood and starts to develop more
elf-like features in their adolescent years, though without ever
becoming an elf in the true sense of the word. A changeling reaches
adulthood at approximately the same age as a human; the changeling then
continues to live a long life but apparently without taking any further
steps in the life-cycle of the elves. This has made some scholars
develop theories stating that changelings are a people of their own,
created by elven magic. Others claim that changelings indeed are
elf-spawn but that their natural life-cycle has been truncated in some
mystical way by growing up among humans.</p>
<p>A changeling’s lot in life is usually a hard one, since few of them
are allowed to stay with their families when their true nature has been
revealed. Changelings are sometimes taken in by witches or wizards to
serve as assistants, but most of them end up on the street where they
have to fend for themselves as best they can. Exiled from human society,
the changeling wanders a long and lonely road, often bitter and dark
minded, in other cases frivolous and indifferent to the hardship of
others.</p>

<p>Changeling Names</p>
<p>Some changelings choose elven names when they are thrown out into the
street or left in the forest, maybe in an attempt to reclaim a lost

Yndaros – take a new and often bombastic name as a defiant gesture or an
expression of independence.</p>
