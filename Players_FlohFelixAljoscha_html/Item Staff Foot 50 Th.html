<h1 >Item Staff Foot 50 Th</h1>
<p>A staff foot forged with strengthening spells can give the staff of a
staff mage extra power when used as a weapon. The artifact is attached
to the staff and gives the user advantage on one melee attack roll with
the staff for each short or longer rest. Even if this artifact most
often is attached to a rune staff, it may be attached to an ordinary
wooden staff with the same effect.</p>
