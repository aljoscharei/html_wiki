<p><strong>Auctions are not good for chases because there are multiple
rolls and there is only one winner, so the relative positioning of the
pursuers is not addressed.</strong> - Wer die Auktion beginnt ist

Auctions - Longer contests like chases or games of checkers can be
played as auctions: - All participants roll a d6 each. They hide the
die, but add the result to the attribute (3-18 ) that their characters
will use in the contest. Which one depends on what the individual
character does, like in a regular contest. - The first participant can
now make a bid that she promises to beat in a successful task roll for
the modified attribute from above. <strong>For instance, someone in a
chase with dexterity 12 and a d6 roll of 3 might bid 2, meaning that she
promises to roll 15 or below, but also more than 2.</strong> -
<strong>The next participant, and anyone after her, has to either make a
higher bid than the last bidder or a bid of 1, a “one-bid.” Note that a
one-bid can only be made as your first and final bid</strong>. You can’t
for example bid 6 and then later bid 1. - Once nobody wants to bid
higher, the d6s are revealed and the player with the highest bid rolls
first. If she succeeds, her character has won the auction, but if she
fails, the second highest bidder has to roll, and so on. Like in any
other task roll, there may be groups and difficulty modifications
involved. - The person with the lowest bid does not have to roll in
order to win if everyone else fails. - You have to make a bid to
participate, and you have to have a theoretical chance of beating it.
<strong>If there are several people with a one-bid, they roll like in a
regular contest (p. 61).</strong> see <a
href="whitehack%20contest">whitehack contest</a>. In 5e <a
href="ability%20check.md#Contests"></a> - The auction mechanism can be
made chaotic (everyone calls out their bids in any order), or more
organized (the Referee or some dice roll decides in what order the
participants get to make bids). Auctions can also be role-played, by
adding a description to each bid: “I take a short-cut over the crumbling
bridge—7!” # Tactics in Auctions - Auctions are tricky, because there
are hidden numbers and player psychology involved. Even if each
participant could know everyone’s stats and hidden d6 rolls, calculating
the optimal bid would be no trivial task. This is not to say that it
can’t be done: Every auction has a mathematical point of equilibrium.
Whoever bids it first has an advantage, and any additional bid is even
more disadvantageous for the one who makes it. Consider the below
tactics: - Bid in small increments—perhaps the opponent stops
prematurely? - Make a higher bid early, because you believe you know the
approximate point of equilibrium. - Bluff by making a really high bid.
Then if someone bids higher, stop. - Double bluff by making a high but
not too high bid. Opponents might wrongly decide to make a one-bid. -
You can’t see your chances in an auction by thinking about it as a
regular contest or by only looking at your modified attribute—often, you
win by someone else failing. The psychology of auctions is that most
players want to be “in control” by being the first to roll, and it is
always more fun to make a proper bid instead of a one-bid. If the
Referee demands quick bids because the characters are pressed for time,
keeping your cool is very hard. Over time, you may also learn the
behaviors of your co-players and Referee (and they may learn yours). -
Extended Auction Use - Auctions are fun and time-saving! Consider using
them for non-lethal battles like duels to first blood. You can also use
them for harmful battles, maybe with groups of lesser enemies, by
deciding beforehand on a (randomized) amount of damage that the losers
will take. Other than the regular attributes, you can base auctions on
ST and AV, and sometimes even on HP.</p>

<p>Auctions are a way to spice up conflicts. Players can roll a d6, keep
the number a secret, and “bid” against the GM (or a fellow player) a
number that works like AC in combat. Highest bidder can roll first,
reveals his d6 roll, adds the roll to the relevant Attribute (or Save
Number, or Attack Value), and makes a “blackjack” task roll (under
Attribute + the d6 result, but over the bid number). Obviously, if you
bid more than what you rolled on the d6 your chance is lower than with a
regular, unmodified task roll.</p>
<p>About auctions: You can’t calculate your chances in an auction that
easily. You may well increase your chances compared to a regular roll by
tricking your opponent to make the higher bid and roll first, as you win
automatically if he fails. But why would you compare your chances in an
auction to an unmodified regular roll? Usually, the alternative to an
auction is an opposed roll of some kind, or a modified roll. When I run
Whitehack, sometimes I suggest to the players to run something as an
auction. At other times, I don’t give them any choice.</p>
