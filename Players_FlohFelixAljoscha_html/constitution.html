<h1 >Constitution</h1>
<p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>
<h2 >Constitution Checks</h2>
<p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution
checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive
rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or
monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond
normal limits, however.</p>
<p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish
tasks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold your breath</li>
<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
<li>Go without sleep</li>
<li>Survive without food or water</li>
<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
</ul>
<h2 >Hit Points</h2>
<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically,
you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit
points.</p>
<p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes
as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example,
if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point
maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit
points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for
4th level using your new modifier. Or if youâ€™re 7th level and some
effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution
modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>
<p>Con = Marathon runner, discipline. So if Con adds to Hp this means Hp
are not merely wounds but also the discipline to grit your teeth and
keep fighting. Witch also makes 0 Hp = unconscious more imaginable</p>
<p>Weight should be based on strengthn not con</p>
