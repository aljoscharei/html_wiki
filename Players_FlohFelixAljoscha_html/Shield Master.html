<h1 >Shield Master</h1>
<p>You use shields not just for protection but also for offense. You
gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus
action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your
shield.</li>
<li>If you aren’t incapacitated, you can add your shield’s AC bonus to
any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful
effect that targets only you <a

5e Conditions Incapacitated</a>.</li>
<li>If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your
reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw,
interposing your shield between yourself and the source of the
effect.</li>

>The
Shield Master feat lets you shove someone as a bonus action if you take
the Attack action. Can you take that bonus action before the Attack
action?</h1>
<p>https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#ShieldMaster</p>
<p>No. The bonus action provided by the Shield Master feat has a
precondition: that you take the Attack action on your turn. Intending to
take that action isn’t sufficient; you must actually take it
<strong>before</strong> you can take the bonus action. During your turn,
you do get to decide when to take the bonus action after you’ve taken
the Attack action.</p>
<p>This sort of if-then setup appears in many of the game’s rules. The
“if” must be satisfied before the “then” comes into play.</p>
