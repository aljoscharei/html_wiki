<h1 >Maze</h1>
<p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a
labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or
until it escapes the maze.<br />
The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it
makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the
spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).<br />
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if
that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
