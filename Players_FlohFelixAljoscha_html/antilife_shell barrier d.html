<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10- foot radius and
moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures
other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the
duration.<br />
The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching
through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with
ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.<br />
If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the
barrier, the spell ends.</p>
