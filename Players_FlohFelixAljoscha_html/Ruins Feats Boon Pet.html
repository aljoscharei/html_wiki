<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Pet</h1>
<p>You have a trusty friend in the form of a jakaar or mare cat â€“ any
beast will do, so long as it is CR 1/4 or less. The pet is unswervingly
loyal to you. In combat and problem-solving you play it almost as a
second character, but you must use your bonus action to coax it to make
use of its action. It shares your initiative count and acts immediately
after your turn. It does not gain experience points and cannot develop
its stats. If the pet dies, the character can have it replaced at the
start of the next adventure.</p>
