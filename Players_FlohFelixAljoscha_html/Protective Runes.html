<h1 >Protective Runes</h1>
<p>At 13th level, you can prepare a special rune that you can use as a
reaction. You must attune to the rune, gaining 1 point of permanent
Corruption. You choose counterspell or dispel magic and can now activate
that spell as a reaction. The spell functions as if cast at 3rd level.
You cannot use this feature again until you take a long or extended
rest.</p>
<p>At 17th level, you can improve your special rune that you can use as
a reaction for another point of permanent Cor- ruption. It now provides
the benefit of counterspell or dispel magic (your choice) as if cast at
6th level. You cannot use this feature again until you take a long or
extended rest.</p>
