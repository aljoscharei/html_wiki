<h1 >Speak with Plants</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (30-foot radius)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and
animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow
your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the
spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures
that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.<br />
You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as
thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the
duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into
difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and
branches to hinder pursuers, for example.<br />
Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s
discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and
move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and
stalks.<br />
If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if
you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to
influence it.<br />
This spell can cause the plants created by the <strong><em><a
