<p>A trebuchet is a powerful catapult that throws its payload in a high
arc, so it can hit targets behind cover. Before the trebuchet can be
fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the
weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it.</p>
<p>A trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, it can launch
other kinds of projectiles, such as barrels of oil or sewage, with
different effects.</p>

proficient with siege weapons.</p>
