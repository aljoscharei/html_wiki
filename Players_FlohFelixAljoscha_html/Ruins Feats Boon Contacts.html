<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Contacts</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
The character has served in an organization or traveled far and wide,
and has therefore spun a wide web of contacts. With a successful DC 10
Charisma check, the character implores a contact to help with a specific
question, precarious situation or other matter. The contact will help to
the extent possible, but rarely risks life or limb. The contact may not
be available directly – that depends on who is included in the
character’s web of contacts. Suitable factions and people when it comes
to specifying the character’s contacts are: the Queen’s Army, the
Queen’s Rangers, Thieves’ Guilds, Witches, Ordo Magica, the Church of
Prios, the Noble Houses and Treasure Hunters.</p>
