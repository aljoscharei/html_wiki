<h1 >Makeshift Tools</h1>
<p>You have proven to be incredibly handy, even when you don’t have the
proper tools. When you need to make a tool check with an instrument you
are proficient with but do not possess, you can substitute scrounged
items instead. If you are not proficient with the tools, you can choose
to count as proficient for this check. If you do so, you can’t use this
feature again until a long or extended rest. If you fail the check your
temporary tools are broken and you won’t find suitable replacements
until after a long or extended rest.</p>
