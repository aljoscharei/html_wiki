<p>description: Descriptions of different conditions affecting players
and creatures from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference
Document).</p>
<h1 >Conditions</h1>
<p>Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and
can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack,
or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but
a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
<p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition
is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
<p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s
effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or
doesn’t.</p>
<p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it
is subjected to a condition.</p>
