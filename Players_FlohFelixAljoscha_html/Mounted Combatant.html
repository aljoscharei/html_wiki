<h1 >Mounted Combatant</h1>
<p>You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted
and arenâ€™t <a

you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <a

on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller
than your mount.</li>
<li>You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you
instead.</li>
<li>If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no
damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it
fails.</li>
</ul>
