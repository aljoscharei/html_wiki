<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked
into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of
stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape
that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock
into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall,
as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a
stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can
have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isnâ€™t
possible.</p>

Works well to make ladderlike handholds in a wall. Can give you enough
stone to kneel behind for cover in a ranged fight. You can use it to
make a very thin but continuous rock cover for a pit trap. Dam a small
stream. Make a door unopenable by pinching the bottom with a stone
floor. Make basic tools such as hammers, knives, and axes (obsidian
counts as stone). Quickly make containers (bottle/bowl/vase/barrel). The
spell can technically facet a gemstone without losing mass to the
grinding process. It could also move all of the impurities in a gem to
one edge that you could then grind off with regular lapidary tools.</p>
