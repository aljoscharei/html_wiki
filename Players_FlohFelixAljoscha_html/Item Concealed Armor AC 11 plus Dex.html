<p>Concealed Armor. Sorcerers have many reasons to stay hidden. To do
this, they often weave mystically reinforced threads into their cloths,
resulting in tunics and capes that look ordinary but offer protection.
Other groups, such as spies, would love to have access to such garments,
so they can avoid unwanted attention while still being ready for
battle.</p>
