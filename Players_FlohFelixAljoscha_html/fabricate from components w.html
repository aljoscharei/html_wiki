<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneou</p>
<p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For
example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope
from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.<br />
Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a
Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight
connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If
you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance,
however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained
within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell
is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.<br />
Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell.
You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high
degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor,
unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to
craft such objects.</p>
