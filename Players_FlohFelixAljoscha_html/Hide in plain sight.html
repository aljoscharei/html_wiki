<h1 >Hide in plain sight</h1>
<p>At 11th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for
yourself and a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus. You
must have access to fresh mud or other naturally occurring materials
with which to create your camouflage.</p>
<p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
least as tall and wide as you are. While camouflaged, you gain a +10
bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You can move at half-speed without
breaking the camouflage effect.</p>
<p>Once you take an action, a reaction or move faster than half your
speed, you must camouflage again to gain this benefit.</p>
