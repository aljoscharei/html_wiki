<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see
within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br />
A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as
a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal
orders to the best of its ability.</p>
