<h1 >Human Background Faithful
of Prios</h1>
<p>While the average citizen of Ambria gives due deference to Prios as
the Lawgiver, you have sought a deeper connection to your god. Even as a
youngster you were taught the ways of the Sun Church. You must choose
how to serve Prios: will you teach the masses as a liturg? Or work
miracles in his name as a theurg? Will you bring his teachings to the
uncultured as a Templar? Or keep his priests safe as a Twilight
Friar?</p>

</li>

<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>The faithful are shaped by the experiences in the temples of Prios
and his teachings. Such duties are rigorous, providing a common set of
knowledge that unites the faith and supports the kingdom. Despite your
religious upbringing you are still human and subject to human frailties
and flaws.</p>
<p>Personality 1. I idolize a champion of Prios and constantly refer to
their deeds and teachings. 2. I was always destined for the Church and
thus take it for granted. 3. I want to help the less-fortunate and the
Church seems the easiest way to do that. 4. My ancestors supported the
Church and it is my time to give it my service. 5. I was lost before the
Church found me and now I finally feel at home. 6. I like the respect
that I receive when I am in my formal robes. 7. I come from humble
beginnings, and I remind everyone of that fact. 8. I sometimes make
references to the Young Gods, and correct myself. My family was into
that heresy, I for sure am not.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Charity. I will help those in need, despite whatever cost I
must pay. 2. Leadership. We must be the beacon that saves humanity from
the evils of the world. 3. Salvation. This life can be grim, but
remember: Prios will judge all of us and grant eternal peace to those he
deems worthy. Shrinking away from pain and challenge is not the way. 4.
Justice. The words of the Lawgiver are the foundation for a life worth
living. 5. Purity. Prios is the only way to a righteous life, all other
ways are sinful. 6. Deliverance. Prios will guide your steps in this
life, if your prayers are sincere. Success follows faith, and failure is
a reflection of your doubt.</p>
<p>Bond 1. Everything I do is for the common people. My family brags
about me and my missions. 2. There is one specific sinner I want to
reach, and hopefully change. 3. I want to impress the Church’s
superiors. 4. I want to leave behind my past and Prios helps me forget.
5. I want to die a martyr of the Sun.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I judge others harshly and myself even more severely. 2. In
order to present an open nature, I forgive all transgressions even when
I should not. 3. I think myself chosen by Prios and I am certain he will
forgive some of my transgressions. 4. I can be blind to my faults,
despite hearing them from others. 5. As I serve Prios others should
serve me. 6. This way was chosen for me, I am very despondent about my
life because of this.</p>
