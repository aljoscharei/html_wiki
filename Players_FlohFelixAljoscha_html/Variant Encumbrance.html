<h1 >Variant Encumbrance</h1>
<p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is
a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how
a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this
variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.</p>
<h1 >What happens if I am
encumbered:</h1>
<p>If you carry weight in excess of <strong>5</strong> times your
Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your
speed drops by 10 feet. Your Travel speed is reduced accordingly <a

<p>If you carry weight in excess of <strong>10</strong> times your
Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead
<strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20
feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and
saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. <a
