<p><em>5th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the
surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of
the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground
settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesnâ€™t function
where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and
towns.<br />
You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about
any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:</p>
<ul>
<li>terrain and bodies of water</li>
<li>prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples</li>
<li>powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead</li>
<li>influence from other planes of existence</li>
<li>buildings</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in
the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the
location of any nearby towns.</p>
