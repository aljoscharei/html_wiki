<h1 >Ruins Traps</h1>
<p>Mechanical traps come in many designs: a snare is a loop of wire or
rope that is tied to a spring or counterweight such that when an animal
takes the bait they are lifted into the air and strangled</p>
<p>Another common design consists of two jagged semi-circles that slam
shut when triggered. A third uses environmental features arranged so
that a boulder or tree trunk smashes down onto the creature’s head when
it takes the bait. Setting the trap requires a Dexterity (Trap- per’s
Manual) check at the listed difficulty. If you’re not proficient, you
have disadvantage on the check.</p>
<p>If the trap you set is designed to restrain the creature, the
creature becomes grappled by the trap and the listed difficulty is the
Es- cape DC for the grapple.</p>
