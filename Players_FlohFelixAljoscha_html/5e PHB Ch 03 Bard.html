<p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a
long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge
springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song —
knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga
it depicts.</p>
<p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale
mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions
to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens
them.</p>
<p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic
over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be
well received.</p>
<p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through
words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds,
create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p>
<h2 ><a

and Magic</h2>
<p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of
air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of
song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse
was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and
that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound
throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and
harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>
<p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards
prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire
their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are
capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic
to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and
illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a
wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets
them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they
set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric
knowledge.</p>

<p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in
a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the
magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural
talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot
the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s
life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories,
and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other
entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a
touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>
<p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural
desire to travel — to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and
new discoveries beyond the horizon — makes an adventuring career a
natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a
variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of
magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic
creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds
firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many
stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these
themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CreatingaBard"></a>Creating
a Bard</h2>
<p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your
character’s background and motivations are not as important as the
stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and
mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you
might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or
your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their
magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of
fey or other supernatural creatures.</p>
<p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following
the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your
own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and
practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or
orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you
might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you
stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift
in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p>

</ul>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardSpellcasting"></a>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in
harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast
repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting"
title="Spellcasting">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of
spellcasting and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spells#BardSpells"
title="Spells">chapter 11</a> for the bard spell list.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#Cantrips"></a>Cantrips</h4>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You
learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown
in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SpellSlots"></a>Spell
Slots</h4>
<p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds">cure wounds</a>
using either slot.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher"></a>Spells
Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell
list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more
bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when
you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or
2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SpellcastingAbility"></a>Spellcasting
Ability</h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your
magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of
your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#RitualCasting"></a>Ritual
Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SpellcastingFocus"></a>Spellcasting
Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#MusicalInstruments"
title="Musical Instruments">Equipment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for
your bard spells.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardicInspiration"></a>Bardic
Inspiration</h3>
<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you
use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one
Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p>
<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and
add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
Inspiration die at a time.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you
finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in
this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and
a d12 at 15th level.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#JackofAllTrades"></a>Jack
of All Trades</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus,
rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include
your proficiency bonus.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SongofRest"></a>Song of
Rest</h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help
revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at
the end of the short rest by spending one or more <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#HitPointsandHitDice">Hit
Dice</a>, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>
<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this
class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th
level.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardCollege"></a>Bard
College</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard
college of your choice: the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CollegeofLore"
title="College of Lore">College of Lore</a> or the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CollegeofValor"
title="College of Valor">College of Valor</a>, both detailed at the end
of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
and again at 6th and 14th level.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#Expertise"></a>Expertise</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain
this benefit.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardAbilityScoreImprovement"></a>Ability
Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#FontofInspiration"></a>Font
of Inspiration</h3>
<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended
uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#Countercharm"></a>Countercharm</h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of
power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a
performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that
time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
on saving throws against being <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened">frightened</a>
or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed">charmed</a>.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The
performance ends early if you are <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>
or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#MagicalSecrets"></a>Magical
Secrets</h3>
<p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide
spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including
this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown
on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p>
<p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in
the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>
<p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and
again at 18th level.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#SuperiorInspiration"></a>Superior
Inspiration</h3>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic
Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardColleges"></a>Bard
Colleges</h2>
<p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap
songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their
knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to
facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CollegeofLore"></a>College
of Lore</h3>
<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes
and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members
might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to
the king.</p>
<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth,
not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble
who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would
rather be honest than politic.</p>
<p>The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual
colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where
they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#LoreBonusProficiencies"></a>Bonus
Proficiencies</h4>
<p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with three skills of your choice.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CuttingWords"></a>Cutting
Words</h4>
<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When
a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll,
an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend
one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die
and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can
choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or
fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune
if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed">charmed</a>.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#AdditionalMagicalSecrets"></a>Additional
Magical Secrets</h4>
<p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A
spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but
don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#PeerlessSkill"></a>Peerless
Skill</h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can
expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and
add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so
after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells
you whether you succeed or fail.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CollegeofValor"></a>College
of Valor</h3>
<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep
alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a
new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around
great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present.
They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure
that the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their
songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment
as the heroes of old.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#ValorBonusProficiencies"></a>Bonus
Proficiencies</h4>
<p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#CombatInspiration"></a>Combat
Inspiration</h4>
<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature
that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the
number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when
an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to
roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass">AC</a>
against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it
hits or misses.</p>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action on your turn.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BattleMagic"></a>Battle
Magic</h4>
<p>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and
weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to
cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
