<p><em>2nd-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range</strong>: Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or
similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br />
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate
cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from
an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action
that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from
the following possible omens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weal</strong>, for good results</li>
<li><strong>Woe</strong>, for bad results</li>
<li><strong>Weal and woe</strong>, for both good and bad results</li>
<li><strong>Nothing</strong>, for results that aren’t especially good or
bad</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that
might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.<br />
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in
secret.</p>
