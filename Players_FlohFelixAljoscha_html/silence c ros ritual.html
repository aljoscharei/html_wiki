<h1 >Silence</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any
creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder
damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a
spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p>
