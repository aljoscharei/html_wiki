Captain Approach Officer lvl 03 Squad Orders</h1>
<p>At 3rd level you can spend time training your fellow adventurers to
work together during combat. Choose a number of other characters equal
to 1 plus your Charisma modifier to join your squad (when your Charisma
modifier increases you can increase the size of your squad). You are
automatically a member of the squad and do not count towards the
total.</p>
<p>When you roll initiative you can give the squad one of the following
orders:<br />
• “Be alert!” Each member of the squad has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks made in combat.<br />
• “Brace yourselves!” If the member does not move on their turn, any
melee attacks against them are at disadvantage until the beginning of
their next turn.<br />
• “Stand fast!” Each member of the squad has advantage on saving throws
or ability checks to resist movement effects. The command is the same
for all squad members and the effect of the command lasts for 1
minute.</p>
