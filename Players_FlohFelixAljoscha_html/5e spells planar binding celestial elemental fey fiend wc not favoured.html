<h1 >Planar Binding</h1>
<p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a
fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for
the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first
summoned into the center of an inverted <a
href="5e%20Spells%20magic%20circle%20keep%20out%20or%20in%20wc%20Kreidekreis.html">5e
Spells magic circle keep out or in wc Kreidekreis</a> in order to keep
it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting,
the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is
bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the
duration of this spell.<br />
A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its
ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an
adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature
obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to
you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If
the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell
ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane
of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns
to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell
ends.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a
6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th- level slot, to 180 days with an
8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
