<p>A siege tower is a mobile wooden structure with a beam frame and
slats in its walls. Large wooden wheels or rollers allow the tower to be
pushed or pulled by soldiers or beasts of burden. Medium or smaller
creatures can use the siege tower to reach the top of walls up to 40
feet high. A creature in the tower has total cover from attacks outside
the tower.</p>
