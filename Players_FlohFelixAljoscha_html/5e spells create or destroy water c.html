<p>Reddit says From what I gather, Create or Destroy Water is really
only useful in 3 niche situations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You need fresh water</li>
<li>You need to put out a fire</li>
<li>You need to clear fog</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I missing something? Are there other creative uses for this spell
I don’t see? A source for water for shape water. Flooding trap
mechanisms. Can be turned into holy water. If it’s cold enough or you
have a way to lower the temperature you can use it to freeze/break
locks.</p>
<p>Soak gunpowder so it won’t explode. Ruin letters so they can’t be
read. If you wanna be petty, make it rain on people you don’t like.
Break into the jerk mayor’s house and soak his bed.</p>
<p>It’s a first level spell that counters another 1st level spell (Fog
Cloud) and also makes it so you’ll never die of thirst in the
desert.</p>
<p>That’s plenty of power for that level and it doesn’t need to be any
more useful than that.</p>
<p>In general, water is a fantastic heat transfer liquid due to its high
specific heat. Pour it on something frozen and it can help thaw it. Pour
it on something hot to cool it off.</p>
<p>Cavitation is another feature. Destroy a chunk of water and it causes
the other fluids to have to fill it in.</p>
<p>Gathering up particles of minerals or such. Basically, water can take
particles in either solution or suspension, and is even called the
universal solvent. You could pour out the water over a floor and scrub
to gather up the particles, then load up the water in a container and
destroy it, leaving the particles behind to sift through.</p>
<p>Source of water for plants that might otherwise wilt and die due to
adverse conditions.</p>
<p>If the temperature is below freezing, the DM could rule that the
falling rain turns to ice when it contacts the surface, making the area
inside the 30 foot cube become difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Drop it on a fire elemental.</p>
<p>For the small price of this low level spell slot, you too can “Save a
Locathah”. Donate today. Another Locathah dies every 4 hours. Your small
contribution will make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Your ship was attacked and there is too much water to get to the leak
to patch it up. Destroy Water upcasted to get rid of enough for your
party to rush to the source of the leak and start fixing it.</p>
<p>Sure, other spells could be better, but the question is if you know
the spells or have them prepared. While sailing you likely will have
<em>‘Create or Destroy Water’</em> prepared for both fresh water if you
somehow run out and to deal with fog.</p>
<p>You can use it in combat to create difficult terrain by making the
ground wet and slick or muddy. You can use the weight of the water to
hold something in place (for example, you could throw a prisoner into a
pit, cover it, put a barrel on the cover, and fill the barrel with water
– 10 gallons of water weighs more than 80 lbs). If you’ve got Mold Earth
as well you can create an instant mini-moat at high level.</p>
<p>By destroying water you could counteract all of those effects.</p>
<p>Create water at the crotch of an NPC you don’t like to make it look
like they pissed themself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your dm if you’re allowed to create water or food inside an
enemy’s gear. Could force a flying creature to take off their armour if
it’s too wet or slow them down. If they’re really generous, cast a wind
based spell and give them a cold.</li>
<li>Couldn’t you use this spell to destroy the water inside of a living
thing and insta-kill them?
<ul>
<li>It specifies open container, you would have to talk to your DM but
honestly that’s super game breaking as a level 1 spell. I wouldn’t
advise it, your DM will probably say no, and it would just make you a
boring op spellcaster.</li>
