<p>If, for some reason, none of those speak to you, you may consider
Phantasmal Killer. Don’t. This spell would be bad as a 3rd level spell.
This spell might be slightly usable as a 2nd level spell. Instead, it’s
priced at a whole 4th level slot. Oof.</p>
<p>The spell both requires your action and your concentration for a save
or die; if they save, the spell does nothing. Alright, that’s not a deal
breaker normally; Polymorph is pretty backbreaking from a balance
perspective, and it’s a save or die. What follows in Phantasmal Killer’s
case is… Cause Fear. That’s what it does, it just frightens the target
of you. For a 4th level slot.</p>
<p>If, by some miracle, at the end of its turn you’re still
concentrating on it and it fails ANOTHER save, you get to deal a whole
4d10 damage to it. 4d10 is roughly 22 damage; Fireball, for a lower
level slot, hits multiple targets, always deals damage, and averages 28
damage. That’s a yikes from me.</p>
<p>Should luck favor you and you manage to get the thing to fail THREE
saves in a row over two rounds while maintaining concentration, you’re
getting 8d10 damage and a fear, and at that point the spell becomes
fine. It’s not amazing or anything; 8d10 over two turns requiring your
concentration is still pretty bad comparatively, but this is the floor
you need to reach to have the effect be remotely worth the slot.</p>
<p>You know what could easily happen? You frighten something with the
spell; it then, on its turn before you’ve even dealt damage with the
spell, it starts hitting you as hard as it can, as it’s horrified of
you. Sure, these attacks have disadvantage, but you’re not a martial
class; your AC is dependent on <a
href="shield%20plus%205%20to%20AC%20reaction%20%20w.html">shield plus 5 to
AC reaction w</a> and <a href="mage%20armor%20AC%2013%20w.html">mage armor
AC 13 w</a> , and even with both sometimes you’re still getting hit and
can immediately lose concentration. You just functionally took the Dodge
action but worse, as now all attacks from other sources still are made
normally, and it cost you a 4th level spell slot.</p>
<p>For this save or suck to go well, you need a creature to fail three
consecutive saves. Three. Don’t cast Phantasmal Killer. Sure, it sounds
cool and edgy and invokes the feeling of a twisted mental mage torturing
their foes with their worst nightmares, but if you want that, just take

Don’t waste your time on Phantasmal Killer.</p>
