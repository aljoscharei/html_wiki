<h1 >Knock</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a
door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object
that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.<br />
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred
becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple
locks, only one of them is unlocked.<br />
If you choose a target that is held shut with <a
href="arcane_lock%20w.html">arcane_lock w</a>, that spell is suppressed
for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut
normally.<br />
<strong>When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away
as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.</strong></p>
