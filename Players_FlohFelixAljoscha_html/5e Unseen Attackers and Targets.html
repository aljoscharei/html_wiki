<h1 >5e Unseen Attackers and
Targets</h1>
<p>Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding <a

lurking in darkness.</p>
<p>When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on
the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s
location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but
the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you
guessed the target’s location correctly.</p>
<p>When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls
against it. If you are hidden–both unseen and unheard–when you make an
attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>
