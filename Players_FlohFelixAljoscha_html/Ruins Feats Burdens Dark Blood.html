Dark blood flows through your veins, passed down from an ancestor, or as
a result of being cursed. Maybe you were simply born in the wrong part
of Davokar at the wrong time. The dark blood always comes with some
effect, roll on the Marks of Corruption table on page 38. The listed
mark is permanent. The character may acquire and develop the following
monstrous traits by selecting them as feats: Natural Weap- on, Armored,
Robust, Regeneration, Wings. (See the Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary for
more information). You gain 2 additional points of permanent Corruption
each time you gain a monstrous trait.</p>
