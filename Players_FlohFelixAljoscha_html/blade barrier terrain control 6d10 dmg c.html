<h1 >Blade Barrier</h1>
<p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a
vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.
The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a
straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a
ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick.
The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its
space is difficult terrain.<br />
When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>

<p>Also known as “The Meat Grinder”, Blade Barrier exists for high level
clerics who want to mirror what Wizards can do with their fancy wall
spells while simultaneously chopping enemies into mince meat.</p>
<p>The spell is ripe for party abuse, and can easily be manipulated to
output huge amounts of damage over and over again.</p>
<p>Effective uses of Blade Barrier can be tricky. If this is a spell
you’re thinking about taking, know it isn’t an every combat kind of
spell. It’s placement, shape, and location relative to others makes or
breaks it. The cover it grants helps it be somewhat generally
applicable, but if you want to use Blade Barrier to its fullest
potential you’ll need coordination and teammates to help.</p>
<p>Blade Barrier’s power is closely tied to its wording; The text “When
a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on <strong>a
turn</strong> or starts its turn there,” allows a creature to
conceivably be damaged in every turn in initiative.</p>
<p>This can happen by a creature both entering and exiting the barrier
on each turn. A simple push in place of an attack from a melee character
can get a creature caught in the blades. Characters with multiple
attacks can get multiple creatures in with no trouble by shoving in
place of each attack.</p>
<p>Getting creatures out of the barrier is a bit more tricky; spells
like <a href="gust%20of%20wind%20push%20away%20w.html">gust of wind push
away w</a> and <a href="5e%20Spells%20thorn%20whip">5e Spells thorn
whip</a> jump to mind as easy ways to get them out safely, and can be
used to get creatures on the other side pulled in. Two characters with
<a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/thunderwave">Thunderwave</a>
on opposite sides of the wall can play ping pong with enemies and rip
them to shreds.</p>
<p>To showcase how to abuse this spell, here is an example round:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cleric acts first, surrounding their allies and a lone enemy
with Blade Barrier.</p></li>
<li><p>The fighter acts next and successfully shoves the enemy into the
barrier.</p></li>
<li><p>The enemy spends its turn disengaging and backing out of the
barrier away from the group.</p></li>
<li><p>On the druid’s turn, they cast Gust of Wind to push the monster
back into the Blade Barrier.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tame example, the single enemy is taking between 9d10 and
18d10 slashing damage.</p>
<p>This isn’t a huge ask for the spell, either; the spell can hit huge
lines of creatures on cast and subsequently be abused to shred whole
groups to bits.</p>
<p>Keep in mind larger creatures can potentially use the meat grinder
better than you; sure, you may initially get your damage in on it and
can make walls to specifically attack larger creatures, but with little
effort large creatures can throw your allies into the spinning blades of
death you created.</p>
<p>Blade Barrier isn’t just a double-edged sword- it’s a million-edged
one. Use it wisely.</p>
