<p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you
choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as
a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be
contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick.
It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space
when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your
choice which side).<br />
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage
and can’t be dispelled by <a
