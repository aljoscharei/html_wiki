This spell creates a swarm of insects 1 hex in size within 12 hexes of
the caster. The swarm may slowly move under the caster’s control; roll
1d6 during the caster’s activation each round, and on a roll of 1-2, the
swarm may move 1 hex. The swarm blocks line of sight. Any units of less
than 3 HD that are contacted by the swarm take 1 uhp of damage and
automatically retreat 1 hex (regardless of battle line, morale, or other
modifiers). The swarm cannot move through walls of fire, and is
destroyed by sleep, dispel magic, flame strike, or fireball. The spell
lasts while the caster concentrates.</p>

<p>This spell summons a vast cloud of swarming insects (usually locusts)
consisting of 4 insect <a
href="ACKS%20Chapter08%20Monsters.md#swarm">swarms</a> (as described in
the Monsters chapter). Each swarm is 30’ x 30’ in size and possesses 4
Hit Dice. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at
least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
area). The caster may summon the swarms so that they share the area of
other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area,
and the whole plague will obscure vision and automatically drive off
creatures of less than 3 Hit Dice. The caster must concentrate for the
duration of the spell to maintain control over the insect plague. The
caster loses control of it if he is successfully attacked or if the
insect plague leaves the range of the caster. While the caster has
control over the insect plague, he can move its constituent swarms 20’
per round. The swarms are stationary once the caster loses control of
the insect plague.</p>
