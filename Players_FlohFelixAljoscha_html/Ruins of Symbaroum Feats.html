burdens provide additional roleplaying hooks and many of them provide a
bonus to an ability score at the same time. Choose from these lists to
provide extra color to your characters, setting them aside from a common
origin or class. ## Boons The following feats generally provide limited
benefits for a specific situation, or might allow a character to do
something that would otherwise be impossible. Many boons provide a
bonus, increasing one of your ability scores by 1 as well. <a

the characterâ€™s history and also provide opportunities to earn
inspiration by using the negative effects in game. Using burdens is
considered an optional rule (even more so than the choice to use feats
themselves), so the gaming group has to reach a common understanding on
whether or not to do so. You might, for example, have each character
begin with a sin- gle burden, improving their stats but setting the
stage for possible disaster. <a
