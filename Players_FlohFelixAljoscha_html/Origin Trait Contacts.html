<h1 >Origin Trait Contacts</h1>
<p>Ambrians are very sociable and end up knowing many folk. You might
have served in an organization or traveled far and wide. With a
successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check you can find out about a
person who should be able to help with a specific question or precarious
situation. The contact may not be available – that depends on the GM’s
judgment of your faction. When it comes to specifying a faction for the
character’s contact, suitable options include: a barbarian clan, the
Queen’s Army, the Queen’s Rangers, witches, Ordo Magica, the Church of
Prios, a noble house or treasure hunters.</p>
