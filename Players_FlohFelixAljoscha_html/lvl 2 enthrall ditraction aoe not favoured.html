<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />

<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your
choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a
Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be <a
href="202202102000%205e%20Conditions%20Charmed.html">202202102000 5e
Conditions Charmed</a> succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and
if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on
the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until
the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell
ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.</p>
<p>https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/enthrall Enthrall is
kind of a cool spell with some potential, but I’m not sure it packs
enough punch to justify its place as a second level spell.</p>
<p>On the plus side, you can captivate a pretty big crowd of people,
keeping their attention firmly fixed on you while your friends enjoy
freedom and anonymity with whatever nefarious schemes you plotted
beforehand.</p>
<p>The possible implications of this are huge. While you’ve got the
crowd’s attention, your co-conspirators could rob a bank, rescue your
ally who’s about to be hanged, or sneak into a party they weren’t
invited to.</p>
<p>That sounds like pretty powerful stuff, right? So what’s the
problem?</p>
<p>Every member of the crowd you’re trying to Enthrall gets to make a
saving throw to avoid the effect. The odds of you effecting everyone in
the crowd are pretty slim, meaning there will likely be a few people who
will be able to spot what you’re up to.</p>
<p>And even if you do manage to captivate the whole crowd, the spell
only lasts for a minute. That’s a pretty tight window to pull off a
heist.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Enthrall can’t be useful for distracting smaller
groups, or even a single NPC. But a <a

Person</a> spell would probably serve you better and last longer. The
temptation to use Enthrall on larger crowds might get you into more
trouble than not using it at all.</p>
