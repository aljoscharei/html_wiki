<h1 >Human Background Common Folk</h1>
<p>You are a member of the largest group of humans, those who work every
day for their food and board. You might be an Ambrian farmer with a
field cut and measured for you by the Queen’s decree and pay taxes to
her representatives for the privilege. Or you might be a barbarian,
hunting or gathering food in ancestral lands according to a schedule set
for you by nature itself. You might be a worker in one of the many
growing communities, as more and more people settle down and learn
trades.</p>

Suggested Characteristics</p>
<ul>
<li>Poets and philosophers often call you ‘the people of the earth’ and
its certainly true that there is dirt beneath your fingernails and
between your toes. But that doesn’t mean that you’re simple minded or
lack ambition… Personality Traits</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>I am content with very little, not because I wish to be poor but
because my needs are small.</li>
<li>I let my hands do the talking, both in work and in arguments.</li>
<li>I bow to no one, noble or not.</li>
<li>I draw extensive conclusions about people’s character from their
looks.</li>
<li>I dream big and talk even bigger.</li>
<li>I am careful not to offend anyone important.</li>
<li>I make talismans for luck, for friends too if they want them.</li>
<li>I often start sentences with “back home…” Ideal</li>
<li>Cycles. There is a time for everything and everything has its time.
Don’t try to force things to come too soon or think that you can prevent
their arrival.</li>
<li>Worthiness. Those folks who work for what they have appreciate it
more than those who are just given things.</li>
<li>Revolution. The rich live off the work of the poor. Time to change
that I think.</li>
<li>Simplicity. It is better for the mind to keep things clean and
uncluttered.</li>
<li>Work. I will work harder and longer than everyone else, and get out
of here.</li>
<li>Modesty. Don’t think you are something special; I certainly am not.
Bond</li>
<li>I love my simple background and the honest people there; I will
always side with them.</li>
<li>My tools mean more to me than just a way to make a living.</li>
<li>I stay close to the people that come from similar circumstances; the
high and mighty make literally no sense to me.</li>
<li>I have found someone to take me out of here, and I have that
person’s back.</li>
<li>Here and now matters; those I travel with, what we do. Who knows
what tomorrow brings.</li>
<li>I yearn for knowledge like my uncle yearned for the bottle.
Flaw</li>
<li>I have a hard time looking beneath the surface of people’s words and
judging their intent.</li>
<li>I think education makes people morally corrupt. Do not trust
them.</li>
<li>Dreams are dangerous; I’m sticking to what little I have, thank you
very much.</li>
<li>Why be sober if you don’t have to. And you don’t have to, since
someone else is already doing the thinking.</li>
<li>Most people don’t deserve what they have; why should I not take it
from them?</li>
<li>People that don’t look like me make me nervous.</li>
</ol>
