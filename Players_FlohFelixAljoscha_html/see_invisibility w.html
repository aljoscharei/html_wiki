<p><em>2nd-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small
sprinkling of powdered silver)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they
were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal
creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.</p>
<p>According to the rules, you can see the creature but you still have
the disadvantage on attacks. This seems very weird.</p>
