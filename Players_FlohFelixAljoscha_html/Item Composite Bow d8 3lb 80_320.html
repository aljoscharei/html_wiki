<p>Composite Bow. Among the wagon-riding Varaks and Saars who live on
the plains west of Davokar, bow-making is a highly esteemed art form.
The composite bow is made from layers of horn and sinews over a wooden
core; it is shorter and not as precise as the longbow but more pow-
erful. Its size makes it perfect for use while on horseback, the
driverâ€™s seat of a wagon or the narrow platform of a battle chariot.</p>
