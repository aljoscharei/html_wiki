Two-Weapon Fighting</a> # Making an Attack Whether you’re striking with
a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as
part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack’s
range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>
<li><strong>Determine modifiers.</strong> The GM determines whether the
target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against
the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects
can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Resolve the attack.</strong> You make the attack roll. On a
hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that
specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or
instead of damage.</li>
</ol>
<h2 >What counts as an attack</h2>
<p>If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as
an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re
making an attack.</p>
<h2 >Attack Rolls</h2>
<p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the
attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the
appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a
character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a
monster is in its stat block.</p>
<h3 >Modifiers to the Roll</h3>
<p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers
to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency
bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is
provided in its stat block.</p>

<p>You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack
using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you
attack with a spell.</p>
<h3 >Rolling 1 or 20</h3>
<p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to
hit and the veteran to miss.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which
is explained later in this chapter.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. <a
