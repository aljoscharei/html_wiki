<p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of
smoke)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything
it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The
spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal
creature isn’t affected.<br />
While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying
speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another
creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has
advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The
target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere
cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The
target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or
otherwise incapacitated. While in the form of a misty cloud, the target
can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or
holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target
can’t attack or cast spells.</p>
<p>What happens if you rematerialize in a narrow space? <a
