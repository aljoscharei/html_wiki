<p>description: Rules for leveling up a character from the 5th Edition
(5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >Leveling Up</h1>
<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or
she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who
reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This
advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p>
<p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants
additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these
features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing
two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an
ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus
increases at certain levels.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that
Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total
to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value
shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll
(rounded up).</p>
<p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if
your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches
8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus
increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point
maximum then increases by 8.</p>
<p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance
in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a
character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s
class description to see what other improvements you gain at each
level.</p>

ist. Downtime rounds mit progress der welt außer im winter.</p>
