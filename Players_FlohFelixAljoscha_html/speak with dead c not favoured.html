<h1 >Speak with Dead</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M
(burning incense)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your
choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The
corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if
the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.<br />
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to <strong>five</strong>
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the
languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive,
and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you
are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t
return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus,
the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that
has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.</p>
