<p>• Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher.<br />
You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters
grappling. You gain the following benefits: • You have advantage on
attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.<br />
• You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To
do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature
are both restrained until the grapple ends.</p>
