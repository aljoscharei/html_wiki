<h1 >5e DMG 04 Creating
Non-Player Characters</h1>
<h2 >Chapter 4: Creating
Nonplayer Characters</h2>
<p>A nonplayer character is any character controlled by the Dungeon
Master. NPCs can be enemies or allies, regular folk or named monsters.
They include the local innkeeper, the old wizard who lives in the tower
on the outskirts of town, the death knight out to destroy the kingdom,
and the dragon counting gold in its cavernous lair.</p>
<p>This chapter shows you how to flesh out nonplayer characters for your
game. For guidelines on generating monster-like stat blocks for an NPC,
see chapter 9, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop">Dungeon
Master’s Workshop</a>.”</p>

<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#DesigningNPCs"></a>Designing
NPCs</h2>
<p>Nothing brings your adventures and campaigns to life better than a
cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, NPCs in your game rarely need as
much complexity as a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most
NPCs are bit players in the campaign, whereas the adventurers are the
stars.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#QuickNPCs"></a>Quick
NPCs</h3>
<p>An NPC doesn’t need combat statistics unless it poses a threat.
Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two qualities to make them
memorable. For example, your players will have no trouble remembering
the no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose on his
right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the broken nose.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#DetailedNPCs"></a>Detailed
NPCs</h3>
<p>For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures, allow more time to
flesh out their histories and personalities. As you’ll see, ten
sentences can sum up the main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence
for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occupation and history</li>
<li>Appearance</li>
<li>Abilities</li>
<li>Talent</li>
<li>Mannerism</li>
<li>Interactions with others</li>
<li>Useful knowledge</li>
<li>Ideal</li>
<li>Bond</li>
<li>Flaw or secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the material here focuses on humanoid NPCs, you can adjust
details to create monstrous NPCs as well.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#OccupationandHistory"></a>Occupation
and History</h4>
<p>In one sentence, describe the NPC’s occupation and provide a brief
historical note that hints at the character’s past. For example, the NPC
might have served in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or adventured
years ago.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#Appearance"></a>Appearance</h4>
<p>In one sentence, describe the NPC’s most distinctive physical
features. You can roll on the NPC Appearance table or choose a feature
that suits the character.</p>

that are above or below average — great strength or monumental
stupidity, for example — and use them to inform the NPC’s qualities.</p>

8</a>).</p>
<p>Ideals can connect to alignment, as shown on the NPC Ideals table.
The alignment connections here are suggestions only; an evil character
could have beauty as an ideal, for instance.</p>

as NPCs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/843/c4-02.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/843/300/689/c4-02.png" /></a></p>
<p>Named monsters that play a significant role in an adventure deserve
the same attention you would give to a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as
well as ideals, bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholder</a>
mastermind is behind the criminal activities in a city, don’t rely
solely on the entry in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a> to
describe the creature’s appearance and personality. Take the time to
give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of appearance, and
especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the Xanathar, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholder</a>
that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of Waterdeep. The
Xanathar’s spherical body is covered in leathery flesh with a texture
similar to cobblestones. Its eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an
insect, and some of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar’s
speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its central eye
away from creatures it speaks to. Like all <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholders</a>,
it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it understands the
usefulness of its humanoid minions. The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath
Waterdeep to access virtually any location within or under the city.</p>
<p>The Xanathar’s ideal is greed. It craves powerful magic items and
surrounds itself with gold, platinum, and precious gems. Its bond is to
its lair — an elaborate cavern complex carved out between the twisting
sewers of Waterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors and
cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures:
finely prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices and herbs.</p>
<p>Establishing this information allows you to play the Xanathar as more
than an ordinary <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholder</a>.
The complexities of the creature’s characterization create more
memorable interaction and interesting story possibilities.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#NPCStatistics"></a>NPC
Statistics</h3>
<p>When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three main options:
giving the NPC only the few statistics it needs, give the NPC a monster
stat block, or give the NPC a class and levels. The latter two options
require a bit of explanation.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#UsingaMonsterStatBlock"></a>Using
a Monster Stat Block</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>
contains statistics for many generic NPCs that you can customize as you
see fit, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop">chapter
9</a> of these rules offers guidelines on adjusting their statistics and
creating a new stat block.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#UsingClassesandLevels"></a>Using
Classes and Levels</h4>
<p>You can create an NPC just as you would a player character, using the
rules in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>. You can even use a character sheet to keep track of the
NPC’s vital information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/841/c4-03.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/841/360/257/c4-03.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Class Options.</em></strong> In addition to the class
options in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>, two additional class options are available for evil player
characters and NPCs: the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#ClericDeathDomain">Death
domain</a> for clerics and the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#PaladinOathbreaker">oathbreaker</a>
for paladins. Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Equipment.</em></strong> Most NPCs don’t need an
exhaustive list of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat
requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the NPC carries (including
magic items that might be used against the adventurers).</p>
<p><strong><em>Challenge Rating.</em></strong> An NPC built for combat
needs a challenge rating. Use the rules in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop">chapter
9</a> to determine the NPC’s challenge rating, just as you would for a
monster you designed.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#NPCPartyMembers"></a>NPC
Party Members</h2>
<p>NPCs might join the adventuring party because they want a share of
the loot and are willing to accept an equal share of the risk, or they
might follow the adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, or
love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you can transfer control to
the players. Even if a player controls an NPC, it’s up to you to make
sure the NPC is portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not
just as a servant that the players can manipulate for their own
benefit.</p>
<p>Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as a party member and
earns a full share of experience points. When determining the difficulty
of a combat encounter (see <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures">chapter
3</a>), make sure to include all NPC party members.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#LowLevelFollowers"></a>Low-Level
Followers</h3>
<p>Your campaign might allow player characters to take on lower-level
NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin might have a 1st-level paladin
as a squire, a wizard might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice,
a cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as an acolyte,
and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as an understudy.</p>
<p>One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to join the party is
that players have backup characters if their main characters take time
off, retire, or die. One disadvantage is that you and your players have
more party members to account for.</p>
<p>Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal party shares of XP,
they will gain levels more quickly than the adventurers (the benefit of
studying under such experienced masters), and might eventually catch up
to them. It also means the adventurers’ advancement is slowed somewhat,
as they must share their XP with an NPC shouldering only part of the
adventuring burden.</p>
<p>Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge for higher-level
characters can deal enough damage to instantly kill or incapacitate a
low-level follower. The adventurers should expect to spend effort and
resources protecting lower-level NPC party members and to provide
healing when this protection fails.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#AdventurerNPCs"></a>Adventurer
NPCs</h3>
<p>If you don’t have enough players to form a full party, you can use
NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs should be the same level as the
lowest-level adventurer in the party and built (either by you or your
players) using the character creation and advancement rules in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>. It’s
easiest on you if you let the players create and run these supporting
characters.</p>
<p>Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters as true to the
NPCs’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws as possible, so that
they don’t come across as automatons. If you don’t feel that an NPC is
being portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give it to
another player, or simply have the NPC leave the party.</p>
<p>NPC supporting characters are easier to play if you limit their class
options. Good candidates for supporting characters include a cleric with
the Life domain, a fighter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the
Thief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#OptionalRuleLoyalty"></a>Optional
Rule: Loyalty</h3>
<p>Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC
party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party
(even those he or she doesn’t particularly like). An NPC party member
who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party,
whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their
goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or
represented by this rule.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#LoyaltyScore"></a>Loyalty
Score</h4>
<p>An NPC’s loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The
NPC’s maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among
all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half
that number. If the highest Charisma score changes — perhaps a character
dies or leaves the group — adjust the NPC’s loyalty score
accordingly.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#TrackingLoyalty"></a>Tracking
Loyalty</h4>
<p>Keep track of an NPC’s loyalty score in secret so that the players
won’t know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal
(even if the NPC is currently under a player’s control).</p>
<p>An NPC’s loyalty score increases by 1d4 if other party members help
the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC’s loyalty
score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for
example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party
member. An NPC’s loyalty score can never be raised above its
maximum.</p>
<p>When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the
NPC’s alignment or bond, reduce the NPC’s loyalty score by 1d4. Reduce
the NPC’s loyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, or
endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.</p>
<p>An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party
and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below
0.</p>
<p>An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to
help fellow party members. If the NPC’s loyalty score is between 1 and
10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer
acts in the party’s best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the
party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret
to bring about the party’s downfall.</p>
<p>Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of the player
characters. They don’t go on adventures, but they can provide
information, rumors, supplies, or professional advice, either for free
or at a cost. Some of the backgrounds in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>
suggest contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are likely to
secure more helpful contacts over the course of their adventuring
careers.</p>
<p>A name and a few choice details are all you need for casual contacts,
but take the time to flesh out a recurring contact, especially one who
might become an ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give
some thought to a contact’s goals and how those goals are likely to come
into play.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#Patrons"></a>Patrons</h3>
<p>A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, providing help or
rewards as well as quests and adventure hooks. Most of the time, a
patron has a vested interest in the adventurers’ success and doesn’t
need to be persuaded to help them.</p>
<p>A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks younger heroes to
deal with rising threats, or a mayor who knows that the town guard can’t
handle a dragon demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by
offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local countryside,
as does a noble who wants an abandoned estate cleared of monsters.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#Hirelings"></a>Hirelings</h2>
<p>Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services in a variety of
circumstances. Information on hirelings appears in chapter 5, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">Equipment</a>” of
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an adventure, and most
require little development. When adventurers hire a coach to carry them
across town or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger is a
hireling, and the adventurers might never even converse with that NPC or
learn his or her name. A ship captain carrying the adventurers across
the sea is also a hireling, but such a character has the potential to
turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the adventure
unfolds.</p>
<p>When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term work, add the cost of
that NPC’s services to the characters’ lifestyle expenses. See the “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#RecurringExpenses">Additional
Expenses</a>” section of chapter 6, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures">Between
Adventures</a>,” for more information.</p>
<p>Extras are the characters and creatures in the background that the
main characters rarely, if ever, interact with.</p>
<p>Extras might be elevated to more important roles by virtue of
adventurers singling them out. For instance, a player might be hooked by
a passing reference you make to a street urchin and try to strike up a
conversation with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you placed
no importance becomes a central figure in an improvised roleplaying
scene.</p>
<p>Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up with names and
mannerisms on the fly. In a pinch, you can plunder the race-specific
character names found in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/races">chapter 2</a> of the
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#Villains"></a>Villains</h2>
<p>By their actions, villains provide job security for heroes. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures">Chapter
3</a> helps you determine suitable villains for your adventures, while
this section helps you flesh out their evil schemes, methods, and
weaknesses. Let the tables that follow inspire you.</p>

Secret Weakness</h4>
<p>Finding and exploiting a villain’s weakness can be very gratifying
for players, although a smart villain tries to conceal its weakness. A
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich">lich</a>, for
example, has a phylactery — a magical receptacle for its soul — that it
keeps well hidden. Only by destroying the phylactery can the characters
ensure the lich’s destruction.</p>

<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#VillainousClassOptions"></a>Villainous
Class Options</h2>
<p>You can use the rules in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> to
create NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create player
characters. The class options below let you create two specific
villainous archetypes: the evil high priest and the evil knight or
antipaladin.</p>
<p>The Death Domain is an additional domain choice for evil clerics, and
the Oathbreaker offers an alternative path for paladins who fall from
grace. A player can choose one of these options with your approval.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#ClericDeathDomain"></a>Cleric:
Death Domain</h3>
<p>The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as
well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities
such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death
knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain
also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or
Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the
underworld (Hades and Hel).</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#BonusProficiency"></a>Bonus
Proficiency</h4>
<p>When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains
proficiency with martial weapons.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#Reaper"></a>Reaper</h4>
<p>At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her
choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip
that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target
two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#ChannelDivinityTouchofDeath"></a>Channel
Divinity: Touch of Death</h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy
another creature’s life force by touch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/839/c4-05.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/839/340/671/c4-05.png" /></a></p>
<p>When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can
use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The
damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#InescapableDestruction"></a>Inescapable
Destruction</h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, the cleric’s ability to channel negative
energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character’s
cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to
necrotic damage.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#DivineStrike"></a>Divine
Strike</h4>
<p>At 8th level, the cleric gains the ability to infuse his or her
weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of the cleric’s turns
when he or she hits a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
When the cleric reaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to
2d8.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#ImprovedReaper"></a>Improved
Reaper</h4>
<p>Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a necromancy spell of
1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can
instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each
other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must
provide them for each target.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#PaladinOathbreaker"></a>Paladin:
Oathbreaker</h3>
<p>An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to
pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned
in the paladin’s heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.</p>
<p>A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an
Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her
Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#OathbreakerSpells"></a>Oathbreaker
Spells</h4>
<p>An Oathbreaker paladin loses previously gained oath spells and
instead gains the following Oathbreaker spells at the paladin levels
listed.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#ChannelDivinity"></a>Channel
Divinity</h4>
<p>An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the following two
Channel Divinity options.</p>
<p><strong><em>Control Undead.</em></strong> As an action, the paladin
targets one undead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him or
her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
target must obey the paladin’s commands for the next 24 hours, or until
the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose
challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin’s level is
immune to this effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreadful Aspect.</em></strong> As an action, the paladin
channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical
menace. Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the
paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a
failed save, the target is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened">frightened</a>
of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened">frightened</a>
by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it
can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#AuraofHate"></a>Aura
of Hate</h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and undead
within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage
rolls equal to the paladin’s Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A
creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a
time.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#SupernaturalResistance"></a>Supernatural
Resistance</h4>
<p>At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#DreadLord"></a>Dread
Lord</h4>
<p>At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or
herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces
any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light.
Whenever an enemy that is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened">frightened</a>
by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic
damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the
aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have
disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this
shadow.</p>
<p>While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or
her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The
paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack
hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin’s
Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>After activating the aura, the paladin can’t do so again until he or
she finishes a long rest.</p>
