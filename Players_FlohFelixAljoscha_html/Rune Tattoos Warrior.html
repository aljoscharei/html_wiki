<h1 >Rune Tattoos Warrior</h1>
<p>The rune crafters of Clan Vajvod in eastern Davokar often tattoo
themselves and their allies with powerful runes. These runes seem almost
alive and glow red-hot when activated in combat. The character carries
such tattoos, either self-made or granted to the character as a gift or
a reward, likely for a service of great importance for the symbolist who
made it.</p>
<p>At 1st level, the rune tattoo protects from weather and wind like a
full set of clothes. When attacked, you can spend your reaction and gain
+4 to your AC until the start of your next turn and you gain 1 point of
temporary Corruption. As long as you choose to continue to gain
Corruption at the start of your turn, you can continue this effect for
additional rounds.</p>
<p>At 3rd level, the rune tattoo adds power to your attacks. Use your
bonus action to empower your weapon and gain 1 point of temporary
Corruption. Add 1d6 radiant damage to each attack until the beginning of
your next turn.</p>
<p>At 6th level, the rune tattoo glows when you take a wound. At the
start of your turn, you can choose to gain 1 point of temporary
Corruption. If so, you regenerate hit points equal to your proficiency
bonus.</p>
<p>At 9th level, the rune tattoo adds even more power to your attacks.
Add 1d8 radiant damage (instead of 1d6) to each attack.</p>
<p>At 13th level the increased power becomes 1d10 radiant damage per
attack</p>
<p>and at 17th level it is 1d12 radiant damage per attack.</p>
