Step-by-step Character Creation</h1>
<h2 >Chapter 1: Step-By-Step
Characters</h2>
<p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons &amp;
Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your
character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and
your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a
class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality,
appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your
character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the
Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p>
<p>Before you dive into <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#1ChooseaRace">step
1</a> below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You
might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a
flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a
sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy
fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of
those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at
the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to
begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons
book to see what catches your interest.</p>

<p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order,
making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of
your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important
is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to
play.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term <strong>character
sheet</strong> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether
it’s a formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece
of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place
to start until you know what information you need and how you use it
during the game.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#1ChooseaRace"></a>1.
Choose a Race</h2>
<p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent
humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character
races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have
<strong>subraces</strong>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf, as well
as the less widespread races of dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves,
half-orcs, and tieflings. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/races">Chapter 2</a>
provides more information about these races.</p>
<p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an
important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural
talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants
particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with
certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the
ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the
capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high
elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be
fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can
be unusual but memorable characters.</p>
<p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which
you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them
later.</p>
<p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be
sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#2ChooseaClass"></a>2.
Choose a Class</h2>
<p><a
href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/jh89sfda89jdshfa98j/01-001-bruenor.png"><img
src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/jh89sfda89jdshfa98j/01-001-bruenor.png" /></a></p>
<p>bruenor</p>
<p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a
character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the
tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon,
fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character
classes are described in chapter 3, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/classes">Classes</a>.”</p>
<p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of
class. Many of these benefits are <strong>class features</strong> —
capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from
members of other classes. You also gain a number of
<strong>proficiencies</strong>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws,
and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your
character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to
telling a convincing lie.</p>
<p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class
gives you at 1st level.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#Level"></a>Level</h3>
<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by
adventuring and gaining <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#Level">experience
points</a> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the
adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a
pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>
<p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the
adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you
are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign, your DM might decide to have
you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has
already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p>
<p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a
higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for
your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level
character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the
minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#Beyond1stLevel">Beyond
1st Level</a>” later in this chapter).</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#HitPointsandHitDice"></a>Hit
Points and Hit Dice</h3>
<p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in
combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by
your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#HitPointsandHitDice">Hit
Dice</a> (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>
<p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is
determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest
roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add
your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is
also your <strong>hit point maximum</strong>.</p>
<p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also
record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit
Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit
points (see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#Resting">Resting</a>”
in chapter 8, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring">Adventuring</a>”).</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#ProficiencyBonus"></a>Proficiency
Bonus</h3>
<p>The table that appears in your class description shows your
proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your
proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on
your character sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>
<li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>
<li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>
<li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>
<li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>
<li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting
class)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw
proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills
are described in chapter 7, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/using-ability-scores">Using
Ability Scores</a>”, and tools in chapter 5, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#Tools">Equipment</a>.”)
Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and
some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character
sheet.</p>
<p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other
number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be
modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a
circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once
to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you
nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only
once.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#3DetermineAbilityScores"></a>3.
Determine Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her
six abilities: <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>,
<strong>Constitution</strong>, <strong>Intelligence</strong>,
<strong>Wisdom</strong>, and <strong>Charisma</strong>. Each ability has
a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/using-ability-scores">chapter
7</a>. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#AbilityScoreSummary">Ability
Score Summary</a> table provides a quick reference for what qualities
are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and
what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>
<p>You generate your character’s six <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AbilityScoresandModifiers">ability
scores</a> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the
highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times,
so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the
idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following
scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>
<p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your
character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any
changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>
<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <strong>ability
modifiers</strong> using the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#AbilityScoresandModifiers">Ability
Scores and Modifiers</a> table. To determine an ability modifier without
consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide
the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your
scores.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#VariantCustomizingAbilityScores"></a>Variant:
Customizing Ability Scores</h3>
<p>At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for
determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to
build a character with a set of ability scores you choose
individually.</p>
<p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each
score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a
score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability
score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t
have a score lower than 8.</p>
<p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set
of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of
numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12,
12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>

Describe Your Character</h2>
<p>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to
flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a
few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she
behaves in general terms.</p>
<p>Using the information in the chapter 4 “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background">Personality
and Background</a>,” you can flesh out your character’s physical
appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Alignment">alignment</a>
(the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Ideals">ideals</a>.
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background">Chapter
4</a> also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear,
called <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Bonds">bonds</a>,
and the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Flaws">flaws</a>
that could one day undermine him or her.</p>
<p>Your character’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Backgrounds">background</a>
describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and
the character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might offer
additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background">chapter
4</a>, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background
that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>
<p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general
benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you
additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record
this information, along with the personality information you develop, on
your character sheet.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#YourCharactersAbilities"></a>Your
Character’s Abilities</h3>
<p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you
flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character
with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a
very smart character with low Strength.</p>
<p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or
athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or
plump.</p>
<p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a
character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy
and thick-fingered.</p>
<p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright
eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be
sickly or frail.</p>
<p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and
studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or
easily forget details.</p>
<p>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a
general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might
be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p>
<p>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually
mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low
Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#5ChooseEquipment"></a>5.
Choose Equipment</h2>
<p>Your class and background determine your character’s <strong>starting
equipment</strong>, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring
gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are
detailed in chapter 5 “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">Equipment</a>.”</p>
<p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background,
you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of
<strong>gold pieces</strong> (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown
in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">chapter
5</a>. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that
chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the
“<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#Trinkets">Trinkets</a>”
table at the end of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">chapter
5</a>).</p>
<p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not
to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your
Strength score times 15. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/using-ability-scores">Chapter
7</a> has more information on carrying capacity.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass"></a>Armor
Class</h3>
<p>Your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass">Armor
Class</a> (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded
in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear,
the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters
wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>
<p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her
Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or
both, calculate your AC using the rules in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">chapter 5</a>.
Record your AC on your character sheet.</p>
<p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear
and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are
determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or
carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">chapter
5</a>.</p>
<p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate
your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to
calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#Weapons"></a>Weapons</h3>
<p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use
when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you
hit.</p>
<p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your
proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and
the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>For attacks with <strong>melee weapons</strong>, use your Strength
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">finesse</a>
property, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/rapier">rapier</a>, can use
your Dexterity modifier instead.</li>
<li>For attacks with <strong>ranged weapons</strong>, use your Dexterity
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">thrown</a>
property, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/handaxe">handaxe</a>, can use
your Strength modifier instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#6ComeTogether"></a>6.
Come Together</h2>
<p>Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role
within a <strong>party</strong>, a group of adventurers working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your
party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons
&amp; Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether
your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests
the group might undertake.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#Beyond1stLevel"></a>Beyond
1st Level</h2>
<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or
she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who
reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This
advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#ClassFeaturesandHitDice"></a>Class
Features and Hit Dice</h3>
<p>When your character gains a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#Level">level</a>,
his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the
class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your
ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition,
every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that
Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total
(minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the
fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of
the die roll (rounded up).</p>
<p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if
your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches
8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus
increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point
maximum then increases by 8.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#XPandProficiencyBonusProgression"></a>XP
and Proficiency Bonus Progression</h3>
<p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance
in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a
character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s
class description to see what other improvements you gain at each
level.</p>

of Play</h3>
<p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers
of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a
general description of how the play experience changes as characters
gain levels.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first tier</strong> (levels 1–4), characters are
effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that
define them as members of particular classes, including the major
choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a
wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats
they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local
farmsteads or villages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second tier</strong> (levels 5–10), characters come
into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the
start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with
spells such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt">lightning
bolt</a>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to
make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become
important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the <strong>third tier</strong> (levels 11–16), characters have
reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace
and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many
spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create
effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other
characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more
impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often
confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p>
<p>At the <strong>fourth tier</strong> (levels 17–20), characters
achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even
the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during
their adventures.</p>
