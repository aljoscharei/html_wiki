<h1 >Sailor</h1>
<p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced
down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink
your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line
of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something
new.</p>
<p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your
Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of
discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it
widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost
with all hands?</p>
<p>What were your duties on board — boatswain, captain, navigator, cook,
or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you
leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?</p>

Ship’s Passage</h4>
<p>When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for
yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you
served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one
captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor, you
can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need.
Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you
need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are
expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a
ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes
their outlook and forms their most important attachments.</p>

Sailor: Pirate</h4>
<p>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless
cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and
lawlessness. You’ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more
than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no
strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in
many a port town.</p>
<p>If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can
choose the Bad Reputation feature (see sidebar) instead of the Ship’s
Passage feature.</p>
<p>Variant Feature: Bad Reputation</p>
<p>If your character has a sailor background, you may select this
background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.</p>
<p>No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your
reputation. When you are in a settlement, you can get away with minor
criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or
breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report
your activity to the authorities.</p>
