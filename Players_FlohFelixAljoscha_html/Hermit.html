<p>You lived in seclusion — either in a sheltered community such as a
monastery, or entirely alone — for a formative part of your life. In
your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude,
and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration#FeatureDiscovery"></a>Feature:
Discovery</h4>
<p>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a
unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation
depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about
the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the
forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You
might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed
some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be
information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to
exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p>
<p>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its
impact on the campaign.</p>

long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and
ideals.</p>

Hermits</h4>
<p>This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that
allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged
wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of
other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if
you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what
you’re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise
and holy person and letting pious fools support you.</p>
