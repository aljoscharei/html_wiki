<h1 >5e Gridded Combat</h1>
<h3 >VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID</h3>
<p>If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other
tokens, follow these rules.</p>
<h4 >Squares</h4>
<p>Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p>
<h4 >Speed</h4>
<p>Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid.
This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly
easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by
5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6
squares.</p>
<p>If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on
your character sheet.</p>
<h4 >Entering a Square</h4>
<p>To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left,
<strong>even if the square is diagonally adjacent</strong> to the square
you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the
sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance on
using a <a href="5e%20DMG%2009%20Dungeon%20Masters%20Workshop">5e DMG 09
Dungeon Masters Workshop</a>
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#UsingMiniatures).)</p>
<p>If a square costs extra movement, as a square of <a
href="5e%20Difficult%20Terrain.html">5e Difficult Terrain</a> does, you
must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you
must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of
difficult terrain.</p>
<h4 >Corners</h4>
<p>Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or
other terrain feature that fills its space. BUT WHAT IF THERE IS AN
ENEMY IN THAT SPACE?</p>
<h5
>IS
IT ALLOWED TO Move diagonally across the corner of enemy space?</h5>
<p>https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/69624/moving-diagonally-across-the-corner-of-enemy-space
If a PC has 4 enemies surrounding him on the north, south, west and east
edges, <strong>is that PC unable to move?</strong> The distribution
would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>O A O
A B A
O A O</code></pre>
<p>O is an empty space, A is an NPC and B is the PC.</p>
<p>ANSWER IS:YES</p>
<p><strong>This PC can move diagonally. Doing so does not involve
moving <em>through</em> a hostile creature’s square.</strong></p>
<p>(See PHB p.192: <strong>Variant: Playing on a Grid</strong>)</p>
<p>Characters (and monsters) can move diagonally like they do
horizontally and vertically, as a one-square move. From the <em>Entering
a Square</em> section we can tell that moving into a diagonal square
doesn’t involve moving into either of the adjacent squares that border
it: with only 5’ of movement left you can enter the diagonal square.</p>
<p>Diagonal movements can be restricted by an obstruction that
<strong>completely fills</strong> the adjacent-not-diagonal squares—see
the <em>Corners</em> section. But that section specifically calls out
terrain and trees—stationary objects, in other words—as the obstruction.
A medium-sized creature does not create this type of obstruction: as
described on the previous page (<em>Space</em>), the opponent
doesn’t <em>fill</em> the square it’s in.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is no recognition of the longer path between two diagonal
centers than between two truly adjacent centers. The PC can move to any
of the corner-spots as one 5’ portion of their movement.</p>
<p>The DMG has alternate rules for counting diagonals as alternately 5’
and 10’ (p. 252), but this only matters for distance considerations—even
under that “Optional Rule: Diagonals” your PC could still move to a
diagonal space.</p>
<p>Beware opportunity attacks, though WHY IS THIS RELEVANT: AN ENEMY
TANK CLOSES A CHOKE POINT COMPRISING OF A DOOR IN A WALL. My friendly
tank shoves him 5 ft. so that my friends can move diagonally past the
brute</p>

<hr />
<h4 >Ranges</h4>
<p>To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures
or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them
and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest
route.</p>
<h3 >Using Miniatures</h3>
<p>From: <a
href="5e%20DMG%2008%20Running%20the%20Game#Using%20Miniatures"></a></p>
<p>In combat, players can often rely on your descriptions to visualize
where their characters are in relation to their surroundings and their
enemies. Some complex battles, however, are easier to run with visual
aids, the most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If you like to
construct model terrain, build three-dimensional dungeons, or draw maps
on large vinyl mats, you should also consider using miniatures.</p>
<p>The Players Handbook offers simple rules for depicting combat using
miniature figures on a grid. This section expands on that material.</p>
<h4 >Tactical Maps</h4>
<p>You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a wet-erase vinyl
mat with 1-inch squares, on a large sheet of paper, or on a similar flat
surface. Preprinted poster-sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard
tiles, and terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun.</p>
<p>The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foot square, and maps
with grids are readily available and easy to create. However, you don’t
have to use a grid at all. You can track distances with a tape measure,
string, craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. Another
option is a play surface covered by 1-inch hexagons (often called
hexes), which combines the easy counting of a grid with the more
flexible movement of using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight
walls and right angles don’t map easily onto hexes, though.</p>
<h4 >Creature Size on Squares and
Hexes</h4>
<p>A creature’s size determines how much space it occupies on squares or
hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature
you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different from what’s
on the table, that’s fine, but treat the monster as its official size
for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a
Large base to represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space on
the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the
purposes of rules like grappling.</p>

<h4 >Areas of Effect</h4>
<p>The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other feature must
be translated onto squares or hexes to determine which potential targets
are in the area and which aren’t.</p>
<p>Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the point of origin of
an area of effect, then follow its rules as normal. If an area of effect
is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that
square.</p>
