<h1 >advantage and disadvantage</h1>
<p>description: Rules describing the advantage and disadvantage system
from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >Advantage and Disadvantage</h1>
<p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have
advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an
attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the
roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the
lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have
disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have
advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
<p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or
imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.
If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll
only one additional d20.</p>
<p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and
disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll
one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage
and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you
have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
<p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game,
such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can
reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a
halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1
and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>
<p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special
abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character
advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in
one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as
a result.</p>

<p>So what are the chances that you’ll roll equal to or above given
number with advantage, normally, or with disadvantage? Here’s a
table.</p>

<p>The effect is huge. There’s less than a 9% chance of rolling 15 or
higher with disadvantage, whereas there’s a 30% chance normally and a
51% chance with advantage.</p>
