<h1 >5e Long Rest 8h</h1>
<h1 >Ruins of Symbaroum</h1>
<p>A long rest requires around eight hours, six of which must be spent
sleeping and the other two in light activity, such as being on watch,
reading, or conversing with others. You gain the following benefits when
you complete a long rest: - You recover hit points equal to the maximum
value of your Hit Die (e.g. 8 for 1d8) plus your Constitution modifier.
This does not count as using a Hit Die.<br />
- You reduce your temporary <a

Corruption</a> by <strong>twice your proficiency bonus</strong>.<br />
- You can spend one or more Hit Dice to recover hit points, up to the
character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to your level.
For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your
Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total.
You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. You
regain spent Hit Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained
below. - You can spend a Hit Die in order to reduce your temporary
Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this
as long as you have Hit Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to
reduce.</p>

<p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading,
talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest
is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity–at least 1 hour of
walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity–the
characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points.
The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal
to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die).
For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain
four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p>
<p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour
period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of
the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
<p>Stan Shinn: LONG REST (8 Hours) : Around 8 hours, no more than 2
hours on watch. Need at least 1 HP to take long rest. Only once per 24
hours. At end of rest, regain all hit points and half of your maximum
number of Hit Dice.<br />
Not in rules but clarifed by the designers: Elves cannot use their
Trance to get the beneft of long rest in 4 hours instead of 8; they
still need 8 hours rest (they simply spend only 4 of it zonked
out.).</p>
<p>At 1st level, if you take a long rest, you regain 1 HD back (despite
rounding down of .5 = 0).</p>
<p>To spend hit dice to heal you need a <a
