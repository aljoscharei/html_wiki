<h1 >Casting a Spell</h1>
<p>compare <a
href="Ruins%20of%20Symbaroum%20Class%20Mystic.md#Casting%20a%20Spell"></a></p>
<p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed,
regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.</p>
<p>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including
the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range,
components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the
spell’s effect.</p>
<h2 >Casting Time</h2>
<p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require
a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p>
<h3 >Bonus Action</h3>
<p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a
bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t
already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell
during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1
action.</p>
<h3 >Reactions</h3>
<p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of
a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a
spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly
when you can do so.</p>
<h3 >Longer Casting Times</h3>
<p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time
to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting
time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action
each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration
while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but
you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell
again, you must start over.</p>
<h2 >Range</h2>
<p>The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell
like <strong><em>magic missile</em></strong>, the target is a creature.
For a spell like <strong><em>fireball</em></strong>, the target is the
point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p>
<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target
only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as
the <strong><em>shield</em></strong> spell, affect only you. These
spells have a range of self.</p>
<p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you
also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the
spell’s effect must be you.</p>
<p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless
the spell’s description says otherwise.</p>
<h2 >Components</h2>
<p>A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in
order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires
verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t
provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the
spell.</p>
<h3 >Verbal (V)</h3>
<p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words
themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the
particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance,
sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or
in an area of silence, such as one created by the
<strong><em>silence</em></strong> spell, can’t cast a spell with a
verbal component.</p>
<h3 >Somatic (S)</h3>
<p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an
intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the
caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these
gestures.</p>
<h3 >Material (M)</h3>
<p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in
parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a
<strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spellcasting
focus</strong> (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components
specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a
character must have that specific component before he or she can cast
the spell.</p>
<p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell,
the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A
spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material
components–or to hold a spellcasting focus–but it can be the same hand
that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p>
<h2 >Duration</h2>
<p>A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A
duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some
spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or
destroyed.</p>
<h3 >Instantaneous</h3>
<p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or
alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because
its magic exists only for an instant.</p>
<h3 ><a href="Concentration.html">Concentration</a></h3>
<h2 >Targets</h2>
<p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be
affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether
the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area
of effect (described below).</p>
<p><strong>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not
know it was targeted by a spell at all</strong>. An effect like
crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an
attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless
a spell says otherwise.</p>
<p>BUT THE CASTER IS USUALLY CLEARLY CASTING A SPELL <a
href="#PERCEIVING%20A%20CASTER%20AT%20WORK">#PERCEIVING A CASTER AT
WORK</a></p>
<h3 >A Clear Path to the Target</h3>
<p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be
behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you
can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that
point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that
obstruction.</p>
<h3 >Targeting Yourself</h3>
<p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose
yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature
other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast,
you can target yourself. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands
and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple
creatures at once.</p>
<h1 >PERCEIVING A CASTER AT WORK</h1>
<p>Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice,
teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display
no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible s ign of their effects,
and could easily go unnoticed by someone una ffected by them. <strong>As
noted in the Player’s Handbook, you normally don’t know that a spell has
been cast unless the spell produces a notice- able effect.</strong></p>
<p>But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone
to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be
perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or
material component. The form of a material component doesn’t matter for
the purposes of perception, whether it’s an object specified in the
spell’s description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p>If the need for a spell’s components has been removed by a special
ability, such as the sorcerer’s Subtle Spell feature or the Innate
Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the s
pell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a
perceptible effect, it’s normally impossible to determine who cast the
spell in the absence of other evidence.</p>
<h1 >IDENTIFYING A SPELL</h1>
<p>Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is
casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their
reaction to identify a spell as it’s being cast, or they can use an
action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is
cast.</p>
<p>If the character perceived the casting, the spell’s ef- fect, or
both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the
reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell’s level. If the spell
is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class,
the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts
a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to
identify the spell. Some spells aren’t asso- ciated with any class when
they’re cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting
trait.</p>
<p>This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact that identifying
a spell requires a quick mind and famil- iarity with.the theory and
practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose
spellcasting ability is<br />
W isdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn’t by itself make
you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their
spells.</p>
<h1 >INVALID SPELL TARGETS</h1>
<p>A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of
creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for
instance), an object, an area, the caster,<br />
or something else. But w hat happens if a spell targets something that
isn’t a valid target? For example, someone might cast charm person on a
creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in
fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following
rule.</p>
<p>Ifyou cast a spell on someone or something that can’t be affected by
the spell, nothing happens to that target, but ifyou used a spell slot
to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has
no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid
target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it
didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an
invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to
the target.</p>
<h2 >Areas of Effect</h2>
<p>Spells such as <strong><em>burning hands</em></strong> and
<strong><em>cone of cold</em></strong> cover an area, allowing them to
affect multiple creatures at once.</p>
<p>A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically
has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.
Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location
from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify
how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a
point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature
or an object.</p>
<p>A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin.
If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a
location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the
spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must
provide total cover.</p>

<h1 >AREAS OF EFFECT ON A GRID</h1>
<p><a href="5e%20Gridded%20Combat.html">5e Gridded Combat</a></p>
<p>The Dungeon Master’s Guide includes the following short rule for
using areas ofeffect on a grid.</p>
<p>Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area
ofeffect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the
“Areas of Effect” section in chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook). If an
area of ef- fect is circular and covers at least half a square, it
affects that square.</p>
<p>That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot
adjudication. This section offers two alterna- tives for determining the
exact location of an area: the template method and the token method.
Both of these methods assume you’re using a grid and miniatures of some
sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number
of squares in a given area, it’s<br />
not recommended that they be combined at the table- choose whichever
method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.</p>
<p>TEMPLATE METHOD<br />
The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different
areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the
length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt
about which creatures are affected by it. You’ll need to make these
templates or find premade ones.</p>
<p>Making a Template. Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper
or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you’re
using.Every 5 feet of the rea equals 1 inch of the template’s size.For
example,the 20-foot-radius sphere of the fireball spell, which has a
40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an
8-inch diameter.</p>
<p>Using a Template. To use an a rea-of-effect te mplate, apply it to
the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface;
otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which
squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under
the template, that square is included in the area ofeffect. If a
creature’s miniature is in a n affected square, that creature is in the
area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn’t enough for a
square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely
or partly covered by the template.</p>
<p>You can also use this method without a grid. Ifyou do so, a creatrue
is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature’s base is
overlapped by the template</p>

</figure>
<p>When you place a template,follow all the rules in the Player’s
Handbook for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of
effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the
template s hould extend out from the caster and be positioned however
the caster likes within the bounds of the rules. Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2
show the template method in action. <img src="Aoe%20Cones%20Tokens.png"
alt="Aoe Cones Tokens.png" /></p>
<p>TOKEN M ETHOD<br />
The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To
use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you’re going to
use to represent your areas of effect.</p>
<p>Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas
of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions
of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.</p>
<p>Using Tokens. Every 5-foot square ofan area ofeffect becomes a die or
other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square,
not at an intersection of lines. If a n area’s token is in a square,
that square is included in the area ofeffect. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as
the tokens.</p>
<p>Circles. This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular
area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere,
cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike,
which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20
feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area
with total cover inside it.</p>
<p>Cones. A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending
from the cone’s point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining
side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine
the number of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For example,
a 30-foot cone contains six rows.</p>
<p>Here’s how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the
cone’s point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally
or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that
one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one
more token. Place this row’s tokens so that their squares each share a
side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally
adjacent to the point of origin, you’ll have one more token to place in
the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created
(you don’t have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing
tokens in this way until you’ve created all of the cone’s rows.</p>
<p>Lines. A line can extend from its source orthogonally or diagonally,
as shown in diagram 2.6.</p>
<h2 >Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid
some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that
the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or
failure.</p>
<p>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting
ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>
<h2 >Attack Rolls</h2>
<p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine
whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus
with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your
proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks.
<strong>Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if
you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that
isn’t incapacitated.</strong> <a

in Close Combat</a></p>
<h4 >The Schools of Magic</h4>
<p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools
of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all
spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way,
whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p>
<p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of
their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p>

<h2 >Combining Magical Effects</h2>
<p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of
those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times
don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect–such as the
highest bonus–from those castings applies while their durations
overlap.</p>
<p>For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that
character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to
roll two bonus dice.</p>
