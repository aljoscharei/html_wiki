<p>School of Transmutation</p>
<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you,
the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight
in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and
learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic
gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.</p>
<p>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into
toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit.
Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>
<h1 >Transmutation Savant</h1>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h1 >Minor Alchemy</h1>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can
temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object,
changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special
alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but
not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a
different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend
performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of
material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you
were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original
substance.</p>
<h1 >Transmuter’s Stone</h1>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s
stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone
yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of
your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When
you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8,
“Adventuring”</li>
<li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is
unencumbered</li>
<li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>
<li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your
choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you
can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</p>
<p>If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to
function.</p>
<h1 >Shapechanger</h1>
<p>At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it
is not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell
slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.</p>
<p>Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using
an available spell slot.</p>
<h1 >Master Transmuter</h1>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the
reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in
a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects.
Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you
finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Major Transformation. You can transmute one nonmagical object — no
larger than a 5-foot cube — into another nonmagical object of similar
size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes
handling the object to transform it.</p>
<p>Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a
creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also
regains all its hit points.</p>
<p>Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch
with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing
to have the spell in your spellbook.</p>
<p>Restore Youth. You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing
creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to
a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s
lifespan.</p>
