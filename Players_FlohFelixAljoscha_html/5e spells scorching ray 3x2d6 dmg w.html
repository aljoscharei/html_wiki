<h2 >The pros of Scorching Ray
are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assuming no attacks miss, it does more damage than Guiding
Bolt.</li>
<li>You have the option to attack multiple targets when using Scorching
Ray.</li>
<li>Eventually, when you have higher level spell slots, it will scale
much better than Guiding Bolt.</li>
<li>Scorching Ray works with the Elemental Adept feat - which allows you
to ignore fire resistance and raises the floor on your minimum damage.

<li>Against enemy spellcasters, Scorching Ray provides more
opportunities to break their concentration. (Credit - <a

</ul>
<h2 >The cons of Scorching Ray
are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It deals fire damage instead of radiant damage. While this is
situational, there are more monsters in the Monster Manual that resist
fire than resist radiant.</li>
<li>It does not grant advantage to the next attack roll against your
target.</li>
<li>If you have advantage for being hidden it will not apply to your
second and third attack.</li>
</ul>
<h2
>The
thing that could be either, depending on how superstitious you are about
your dice (and what the AC of your target is):</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scorching Ray makes three separate attack rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 >You would want to use
Scorching Ray if:</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are multiple targets that you are confident in your ability to
hit.</li>
<li>You are fighting something that is vulnerable to fire damage.</li>
<li>You need to deal more damage right now.</li>
</ul>
<h2 >You would want to use
Guiding Bolt if:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to set an ally up for an upcoming attack against the same
target.</li>
<li>Your allies are having a hard time landing attacks against the
target.</li>
<li>Your next ally to attack is a rogue who will get sneak attack damage
from the advantage. (Credit - <a
href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/6203/dale-m">DaleM</a>)</li>
<li>There is only one target. (You may wish also just not upcasting
Guiding Bolt in this scenario and relying on your party to use the
advantage.)</li>
<li>You have advantage on this attack (ie you are hidden).</li>
</ul>
