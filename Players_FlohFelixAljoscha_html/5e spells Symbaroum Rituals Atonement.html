<p>Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch Components: V Duration:
Special</p>
<p>You are able to lighten the spiritual burdens of a non- possessed,
willing person; this is done by the sinner accept- ing to perform a task
for the theurg on behalf of the Church. The task must be time-consuming,
expensive, or dangerous (or perhaps a combination of these factors).
Upon comple- tion of the task, the targetâ€™s permanent Corruption is
reduced by 1d3 + 1.</p>
<p>If the target goes a month or more without making effort towards the
task, the spell ends and the target gains one point of permanent
Corruption for failing Prios.</p>
