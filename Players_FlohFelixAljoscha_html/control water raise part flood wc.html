<h1 >Control Water</h1>
<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of
dust)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an
area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose
from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action
on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different
one.<br />
<strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all
<strong>standing water</strong> in the area to rise by as much as 20
feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto
dry land.<br />
If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a
20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other
and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path
are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.<br />
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a
different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on
the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br />
<strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart
and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the
separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until
the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly
fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal
water level is restored. <strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause
<strong>flowing water</strong> in the area to move in a direction you
choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in
other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it,
but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on
the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you
chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
<strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at
least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in
the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide
at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is
pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by
making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br />
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex
until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half
damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex
can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described
above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do
so.<br />
The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object
takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains
in the vortex.</p>

When cast, this spell creates a 3 hex wide ford (p. 32) anywhere within
6 hexes of the caster. It lasts for the duration of the battle, or until
dispelled. This spell can be cast before battle during set-up provided
the caster’s army was not surprised.</p>

<p>This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as
much as 2’ per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is
lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are
up to 10’ long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of
water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps
ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering
them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this
spell acts as a slow spell (the reverse of haste); a save versus Spells
is allowed, with success negating the effect. The spell has no effect on
other creatures.</p>
