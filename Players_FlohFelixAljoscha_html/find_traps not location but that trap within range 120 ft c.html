<p>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line
of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that
would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or
undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the <a

5e ROS Ritual</a> spell, a <a
href="5e%20spells%20glyph%20of%20warding%20magical%20trap%20wc.html">5e

but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable
ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole. <strong>This spell merely reveals that a
trap is present</strong>. You donâ€™t learn the location of each trap, but
you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you
sense.</p>
