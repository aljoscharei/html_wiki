<p>You influence the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You
must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t
have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you change one of the current weather
conditions, which are determined by the GM based on climate and season.
You can change one of the following: precipitation, temperature, or
wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new condition to take effect.
Once it does so, you can change one of the conditions (the same or
another) again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to
normal.</p>
<p>When you change a weather condition, find the current condition on
the following tables and change its stage by one up or down. When
changing the winds, you can change its direction by one step (for
example, from north to north-east or from south-west to south,
etc.).</p>
