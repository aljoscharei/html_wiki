<p>War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You
trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic
survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You
might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company,
or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a
recent war.</p>
<p>When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which
military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you
progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military
career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or
it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s private army, or a mercenary
company.</p>

Military Rank</h4>
<p>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers
loyal to your former military organization still recognize your
authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower
rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers
and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can
also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses
where your rank is recognized.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military
service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating
strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear,
shame, and hatred.</p>
