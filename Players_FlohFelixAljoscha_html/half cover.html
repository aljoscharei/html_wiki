<h1 >half cover</h1>
<p>A target with <strong><a href="half%20cover.html">half
cover</a></strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A
target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.
The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a
friend.</p>
