<p>description: Rules for managing movement and travel from the 5th
Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >Movement</h1>
<p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,
scaling a treacherous mountain slope–all sorts of movement play a key
role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p>
<p>The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating
exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find
the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a
dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can
summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at
the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,
which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by
a narrow stone arch.”</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get
from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or
minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors:
the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain
they’re moving over.</p>
<h2 >Speed</h2>
<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in
feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number
assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a
life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a
character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
<h3 >Travel Pace</h3>
<p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast,
or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how
far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any
effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Forced March.</strong> The Travel Pace table assumes that
characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that
limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>
<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters
cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each
character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.
The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a
character suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to
an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted
character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the
usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to
10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this
is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace
as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of
the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the
crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>
<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special
vehicles, such as a <em>carpet of flying</em>, allow you to travel more
swiftly.</p>
<p>The Pace is given for a Character with a speed of 30 ft/round.</p>

<h3 >ADVANCED RULE - EXPEDITION
SPEED</h3>
<p>https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46101/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-2-wilderness-travel</p>
<p>An expedition’s speed is based on the walking speed of its slowest
member.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1 hour at normal pace, the expedition can travel a number of
miles equal to its speed divided by 10.</li>
<li>At a fast pace, the expedition can travel 150% of its normal
speed.</li>
<li>At a slow pace, the expedition can travel two-thirds of its normal
speed.</li>
<li>At an exploration pace, the expedition can travel one-half of its
normal speed.</li>
<li>Calculate distance per watch based on the expedition’s hourly
speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the tables below, distances have been rounded to the nearest half
mile.</p>

Difficult Terrain</a></h3>
<h2 >Special Types of Movement</h2>
<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often
involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb,
crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>
<h3 >Climbing, Swimming, and
Crawling</h3>
<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot
(2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or
swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface
or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<h3 >Jumping</h3>
<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump. <a
