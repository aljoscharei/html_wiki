yourself and any nearby allies and enemies within the eye of the storm,
a 15-foot radius, remaining unharmed.</p>
<p>The storm heavily obscures <a href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e

Conditions Blinded</a> . In order to take an action, they must first
succeed at a Wisdom saving throw. On a success they are able to act this
turn.</p>
<p>The blood storm also has a drowning effect; it actively aims for the
mouth and nose. If a creature starts its turn in the storm, the creature
must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 necrotic damage on a
failed save or half that on a successful one. The only way to avoid the
effect is to leave the storm’s area of effect, move into the eye area,
or find a structure that can be completely closed off from the storm’s
effects.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move the cloud up to 10
feet in a direction that you choose.</p>
