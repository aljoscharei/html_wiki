<h1 >Unseen Servant</h1>
<p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of
wood)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that
performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant
springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within
range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it canâ€™t
attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.<br />
Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command
the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The
servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires,
serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant
performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the
task, then waits for your next command.<br />
If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more
than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>
