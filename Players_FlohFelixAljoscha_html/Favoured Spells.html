<h1 >Favoured Spells</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>There are certain spells that a mystic has studied extensively,
so much that they can mitigate the corrupting influence of the familiar
magic.</p></li>
<li><p>At 1st level, you can select 2 cantrips and 1 leveled
spell.</p></li>
<li><p>When you cast a favored cantrip you gain no Corruption,
and</p></li>
<li><p>when you cast a leveled favored spell you gain Corruption equal
only to the level of the spell.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you gain a level of mystic you can make more spells
favored, as shown on the Mystic table under Favored Spells, the first
number is the current amount of favored cantrips and the second number
is for leveled spells.</p></li>
<li><p>When you cast a favored spell at a higher level you add the new
level as Corruption instead of the base level. For example, if you cast
a favored 3rd level spell at 5th level, you gain 5 temporary Corruption
instead of 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain spells are poorly researched, unreliable, or on the edge
of dark sorcery. These spells cannot be favored. Unfavored spells are
marked with an asterisk (*) in the spell lists found beginning on page
187.</p></li>
