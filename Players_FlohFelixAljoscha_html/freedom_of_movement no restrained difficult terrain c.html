<h1 >Freedom of Movement</h1>
<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the
arm or a similar appendage)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement
is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects
can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be
paralyzed or restrained.<br />
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape
from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it
grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s
movement or attacks.</p>
