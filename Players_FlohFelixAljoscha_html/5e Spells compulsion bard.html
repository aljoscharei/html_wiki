<h1 >Compulsion</h1>
<p><em>4th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can
hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically
succeeds on this saving throw if it can’t be charmed. On a failed save,
a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a
bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is
horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement
as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its
action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another
Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.<br />
A target isn’t compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such
as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the
designated direction.</p>
