<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Manipulator</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
You know how to manipulate others, using flattery, threats, or a
combination thereof. It takes time to influence someone; it requires a
scene of emotional manipulations to achieve the intended effect. Once
you’ve chosen a victim, you have advantage on Charisma checks for that
manipulation. On the other hand, the influence lasts longer than when
simply lying – the victim accepts the sentiments as its own and will
defend them long after the manipulator has left the place.</p>
