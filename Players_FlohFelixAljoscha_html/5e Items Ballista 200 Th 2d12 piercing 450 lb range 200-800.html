Items Ballista 200 Th 2d12 piercing 450 lb range 200-800</h1>
<p>Ballista. Essentially, this is a massive, stationary cross- bow,
intended to fire at fixed targets, troop formations on the field and
monsters of the most robust sort. In The Great War, the ballista was
used against the undead draft beasts of the Dark Lords, with the intent
of stopping their siege towers from reaching the ramparts. This
continued during the colonization of Ambria, with the tame beasts of the
barbarian warlords as the primary targets. Even today, ballistae are
aimed towards Davokar from atop outposts and wall-towers. <a
