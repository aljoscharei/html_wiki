<h1 >Dimension Door</h1>
<p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 500 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous Y</p>
<p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot
within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place
you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating
distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward
to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.”<br />
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what
you can carry. You can also bring <strong>one</strong> willing creature
of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying
capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this
spell.<br />
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a
creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force
damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.</p>
