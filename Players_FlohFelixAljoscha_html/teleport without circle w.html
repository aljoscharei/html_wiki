<p><em>7th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that
you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an
object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it
can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.<br />
The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the
same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and
consults the table.</p>

<p><strong>Familiarity.</strong> “Permanent circle” means a permanent
teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object”
means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination
within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret
tomb.<br />
“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have
carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen
casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you
aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once,
possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and
appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a
map.<br />
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to
scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are
attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer
exists.<br />
<strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object)
appear where you want to.<br />
<strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object)
appear a random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance
that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles,
landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would
be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the
direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as
north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the
compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles
out at sea, you could be in trouble.<br />
<strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object)
wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to
the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for
example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an
alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as
your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but
since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up
anywhere on the plane.<br />
<strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object)
takes <strong>3d10 force damage</strong>, and the GM rerolls on the
table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing
damage each time). <a

When this spell is cast, roll 1d100. On a 1-95, the caster may be placed
anywhere on the battlemap, as desired. On a 96-100, the caster is
removed from play.</p>

<p>This spell instantly transports the creature touched to a designated
destination, which may be any distance. When the spell works properly,
the transported creature, carrying up to its full encumbrance load, will
arrive at “ground” level in a suitable open place. If transporting an
unwilling target, it is entitled to resist with a saving throw versus
Spells. The chance of the teleportation working correctly will depend on
how familiar the caster is with the location and layout of the
destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely the
teleportation works. To determine how well the teleportation works, roll
d% and consult the table below.</p>
<p>A “very familiar” place is one the caster has been very often, such
as his home or laboratory. Places that are “studied carefully” include
those known well, either because the caster can currently see it, he has
been there often, or has used other means (such as scrying) to study the
place for at least one hour. Places that are “seen casually” are those
that the caster has seen more than once but with which he is not very
familiar. Places that are “’viewed once” include any that the caster has
seen once.</p>

<p>A creature arriving “On Target” appears in the desired location. A
creature arriving “Off Target” appears 1d10x10 feet away from the target
in a random direction. Should this location already be occupied by solid
matter, the creature is instantly killed; if this location is above the
ground, the creature will take falling damage as it plummets to earth. A
creature arriving “Lost” simply does not reappear at all. Whether such
creatures are disintegrated, trapped forever in some unknown plane of
existence, or transported to some distant time and place is a matter of
debate among the wise. Note that the caster cannot intentionally
teleport himself or another creature into thin air, off target, or into
solid matter.</p>
