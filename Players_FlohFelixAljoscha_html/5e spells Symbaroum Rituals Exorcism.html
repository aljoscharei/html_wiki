<p>You call out to Prios to purge the immediate area of any creature
that is not native to the material world and anoint everything else with
his holy water. At the end of the casting time, each extraplanar
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you can see the creature as
you cast the spell (for example it is trapped within a magic circle or
otherwise confined) then it has disadvantage on its saving throw. An
exorcised creature cannot return to the material world until at least 24
hours have passed.</p>
