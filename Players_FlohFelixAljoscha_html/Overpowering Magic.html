<h1 >Overpowering Magic</h1>
<ul>
<li>At 13th level, when you cast a 1st - 5th level spell that requires
an action to cast, you can use your bonus action to empower that spell.
When you roll damage for the spell, you can reroll any 1s or 2s on the
dice. (You must use the new value, even if it is a 1 or 2.) You must
take a long or extended rest before you use this feature again.</li>
</ul>
