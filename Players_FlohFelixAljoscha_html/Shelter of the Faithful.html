<h1 >Shelter of the Faithful</h1>
<p>As a servant of Prios, you command the respect of the common folk,
and you can perform the religious ceremonies needed in everyday life.
You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing
and care at a temple or other established presence of Prios, but you
must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>
<p>You might also have ties to a specific home temple and you have a
residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if
you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new
home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for
assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you
remain in good standing with your temple.</p>
