Hide</h1>
<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check
in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed,
you gain certain benefits, as described in the “<a
href="5e%20Unseen%20Attackers%20and%20Targets.html">5e Unseen Attackers
and Targets</a>” section later in this chapter.</p>

<li><h2 >How Does Hide Work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you decide you want to hide, your DM first decides whether it’s
reasonable that your character could attempt to hide in this
situation.<br />
</li>
<li>Generally, this determination is based on how clearly enemies can
see you. If the DM decides your character can try to hide, you then make
a stealth roll. This roll must beat the passive perception of
<strong>all</strong> creatures you’re trying to hide from.<br />
</li>
<li>The roll is also contested by perception rolls by any creatures that
are actively searching for or focusing on your character. If the stealth
roll succeeds against all of these things, your character becomes
hidden.<br />
## Hiding in Combat and Hidden Combatants<br />
You can try to hide in combat by using your action, on your turn. In the
same way as when hiding outside of combat, the DM first rules whether or
not you could reasonably attempt to hide.<br />
When you attempt to hide in combat, it’s usually assumed that all enemy
combatants are actively paying attention to you so your stealth roll
will usually be contested by perception rolls from all enemy<br />
combatants.<br />
It’s also assumed that all enemy combatants are paying attention to
their surroundings so if, when you’re<br />
hidden, you leave cover and openly approach an enemy, that enemy will
generally spot you automatically<br />
and without needing to make any perception rolls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether You’re In Ccover<br />
This often is the most important factor. Usually, when you’re attempting
to hide, you need to be behind cover. The degree of cover you need may
vary based on other factors that obscure vision.<br />
Some DMs may also be more or less lenient with cover requirements – some
DMs prefer that your<br />
character is behind full cover while some may allow you to hide behind
partial cover.<br />
For the purposes of hiding, it’s worth noting that cover only needs to
obstruct vision and doesn’t need to provide ballistic cover.</p>
<p>For example, light foliage won’t stop an arrow in flight but it will
still obstruct an enemy’s vision of you. This means that some objects
will provide a greater degree of cover when determining if you can
hide<br />
than they would when resolving attack rolls.<br />
Simultaneously, a thick glass window might be more effective at
deflecting arrows than at obstructing<br />
vision.</p>
<p>Rogues and Hiding<br />
Rogues usually hide more than any other player characters. Rogues’
Cunning Action ability allows them<br />
to hide (amongst other things) as a bonus action.<br />
This is very powerful – other classes need to use their action if they
want to hide which precludes<br />
attacking, casting, or doing other useful things on that turn. This
means rogues sacrifice a lot less when<br />
they hide.<br />
Rogues’ other abilities also synergize well with hiding. Attacking while
unseen grants advantage on attack<br />
rolls and rogues’ Sneak Attack ability grants extra damage when they
attack with advantage</p></li>
