<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and
iron)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and
creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration,
celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on
attack rolls against you.<br />
You can end the spell early by using either of the following special
functions.<br />
<strong>Break Enchantment.</strong> As your action, you touch a creature
you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial,
an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no
longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.<br />
<strong>Dismissal.</strong> As your action, make a melee spell attack
against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can
reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home
plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent
back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on
their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to
the Feywild.</p>

This spell affects all units within 1 hex of the caster. If the affected
units are enchanted or undead creatures, they must make a successful
saving throw versus Spells or be destroyed. Affected enchanted or undead
units may not make melee attacks against the caster’s unit. The spell
lasts as long as the caster concentrates.</p>

30’ | |:——— |:—— | | Divine | 5 | | Duration: | 1 turn |</p>
<p>When this spell is cast, the caster can take no other action but
concentrate on the spell for the entire duration. All undead or other
enchanted creatures that come within 30’ of the caster must succeed in a
saving throw versus Death or be destroyed. Any creature that makes this
saving throw will instead flee from the affected area. Instead of
casting the spell in a 30’ radius, the caster can direct the spell at
one monster only, and that monster saves with a -2 penalty. Casting
dispel evil upon an unholy place or shrine can sometimes rid the place
of evil (Judge’s discretion). In addition, dispel evil can be used to
remove a cursed item from a being within the spell range; doing so
discharges and ends the spell.</p>
