<p>Corruption</p>
<p>For practitioners of witchcraft Corruption is viewed as nature’s way
of seeking balance; what the witch does to the world strikes back
against him or her. The Corruption must be weighed against the necessity
of what the witch is about to do and be handled accordingly. Some
witches will choose to sacrifice themselves to the Corruption in order
to save their people; such is the fate of a witch according to the
demands of life in the gloom of Davokar.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>You are sensitive to the natural flow of magic and the ancient power
of the land. You use <strong>Wisdom</strong> as your spellcasting
ability modifier. You learn spells from the Witch tradition list. <a
