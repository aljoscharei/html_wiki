<h1 >Item Transforming Draught</h1>
<p>Weak DC 13 10 Th d4 Moderate DC 15 20 Th d3 Strong DC 17 30 Th 1 This
is a powerful mutagen which transforms the body of the user in a
monstrous way. During a scene the user is twisted into a half-bestiaal
creature and has disadvantage on all Charisma checks until the effect
wears off. The draught gives the user a monstrous trait for the rest of
the scene; the level of the trait is decided by the strength of the
elixir. In addition, each dose consumed deals temporary Corruption, also
determined by the strength of the elixir. Of course, the physical
transfor- mation and the corrupting effect is reason enough for the
elixir to be banned and only available on Ambria’s black market. The
following monstrous traits (see Bestiaal in the Bes- tiary) can be
acquired, decided by the alchemist when brewing the elixir:</p>
<p>• Weak. The elixir gives either Aggressive or Awareness, at the cost
of 1d4 temporary Corruption.</p>
<p>• Moderate.TheelixirgiveseitherBite,Claws,orLeathery Skin, at the
cost of 1d6 temporary Corruption.</p>
<p>• Strong.TheelixirgiveseitherBloodFrenzy,Enlarge,Re- duce, or Wings,
at the cost of 1d8 temporary Corruption.</p>
