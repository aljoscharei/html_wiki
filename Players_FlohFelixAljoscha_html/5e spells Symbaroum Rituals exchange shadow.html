<p>You can exchange your Shadow with another creature. If the creature
is unwilling, it is able to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the
effect. A successful save prevents the process and alerts the target. A
failed saving throw indicates that the swap was successful and the
target is unaware of the exchange. Your Shadow appears as the targetâ€™s
Shadow and their Shadow appears as yours.</p>
