<h1 >Chain Lightning</h1>
<p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber,
glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your
choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that
target to as many as <strong>three</strong> other targets, each of which
must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature
or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.<br />
A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the
first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.</p>
