Lacquered Silk Cuirass 14 plus Dex max 2 18 lb</h1>
<p>Lacquered Silk Cuirass. Barbarian warriors that have earned their
place in the guard of a wealthy clan chieftain can sometimes be seen
wearing a cuirass of lacquered silk, an armor that despite its apparent
lightness pro- tects like a breast plate. According to legend, the
secret of lacquered silk was given to humankind by the elves, in a time
when the Iron Pact was still strong and humans battled the parasitic
darkness of Symbaroum.</p>
