<p>The world is old and many spirits linger from days past; na- ture
spirits in dirt and water, or dead heroes who have not yet passed over
to the other side. You contact these spirits and ask for their help.
This help takes one of the following three forms:</p>
<p>• You can ask the spirits what important thing occurred</p>
<p>here in the past. Note that spirits have a very limited un-
derstanding of time, so a battle that occurred 500 years ago might be
more interesting to them than the murder that happened yesterday.</p>
<p>• You can ask them three yes or no questions that they will try to
answer as accurately as possible. However, they are limited by their
knowledge and won’t do well with questions outside their own
experiences.</p>
<p>• You can name or describe an enemy. For the next 24 hours if that
enemy approaches within 30 feet of your current location the spirits
will attack them. At the start of its turn each specified creature must
make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they
be- come frightened of the area and take 1d6 psychic damage. On a
success they are not frightened but still take 1d6 psychic damage.</p>
