<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your
turns as an action.</p>
