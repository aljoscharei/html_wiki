<h1 >Instant Summons</h1>
<p><em>6th-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest
dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its
surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you
use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must
use a different sapphire.<br />
At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name
and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand
regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.<br />
If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the
sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who
the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is
located at that moment.<br />
