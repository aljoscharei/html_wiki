<h1 >Combat Mastery</h1>
<p>At 9th level, your continuing dedication to your weapon training
provides another feature:<br />
- For Sword Saints, you can use your reaction after a missed melee
attack to make a single attack roll against that attacker with your
sword if the attacker is in reach.<br />
- For Axe Artists, you score a critical hit with either of your axes
when you roll a 19 or 20 on the d20 for an attack roll. - For Spear
Dancers, when you make a successful attack roll you can use your bonus
action to force the target creature to make a Dexterity saving throw
with the DC equal to the attack roll. On a failure, the creature is
knocked prone.<br />
- For Flailers, when you miss with your weapon you can use your reaction
to whip the chain back and make a second attack roll.</p>
