<h1 >Awaken</h1>
<p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 8 hours<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a
precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The
target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or
less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the
ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it
gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so
forth, and it gains senses similar to a humanâ€™s. Your GM chooses
statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics
for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.<br />
The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you
or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition
ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you,
based on how you treated it while it was charmed.</p>
