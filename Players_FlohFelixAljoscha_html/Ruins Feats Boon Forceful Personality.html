<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon
Forceful Personality</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
You know how to be threatening in an effective way and can scare people
into acting according to your will, if only for a short while. You have
advantage on Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) checks pertaining to
threats, interrogation and coercion. The effect is momentary; later the
victim will likely retaliate against you when a chance presents
itself.</p>
