<h1 >Member of the Church</h1>
<p>If given the chance, you can prove yourself to be a member of the Sun
Church and gain shelter there for yourself and your companions.
Unfortunately, some of the faithful are not as open-minded as your
teachers and the GM might require you to make a DC 10 Charisma
(Persuasion) check in order to receive healing or other Church
services.</p>
