<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Servant</h1>
<p>You have a personal servant. It may be an employed atten- dant, a
serf chamber boy or something like that. The servant is loyal to you,
but is otherwise useless in terms of skills. It can perform simple
chores, stand guard at night or convey messages to others, but it will
not contribute in dangerous situations. The servant is played by the
Gamemaster and should be provided a suitable personality.</p>
