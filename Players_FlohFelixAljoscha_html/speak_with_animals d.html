<p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with
beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is
limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you
information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they
can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to
persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GMâ€™s
discretion.</p>
