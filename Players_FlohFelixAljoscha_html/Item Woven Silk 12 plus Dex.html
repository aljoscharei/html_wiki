<h1 >Item Woven Silk 12 plus Dex</h1>
<p>Woven Silk. Woven silk is the finest light armor available, since the
close weave of its threads withstands stabs and cuts far better than its
weight suggests. Woven silk has been used by both barbarians and
Ambrians for a long time and some scholars speculate that the technique
orig- inally comes from the elves, possibly dating as far back as the
days of the Iron Pact.</p>
