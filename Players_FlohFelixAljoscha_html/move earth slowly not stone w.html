<p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag
containing a mixture of soils–clay, loam, and sand)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 2 hours</p>
<p>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within
range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you
choose for the duration. <strong>That is ambiguous. It means you can
shape the area for 2 hours, but the changes are permanent.</strong> You
can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench,
erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such
changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you
affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high,
raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to
complete.<br />
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you
can choose a new area of terrain to affect.<br />
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the
area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.<br />
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks
and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you
shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
collapse.<br />
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved
earth carries any plants along with it.</p>

When cast, this spell enables the caster to place or remove terrain
features, including hills, broken ground, mud, trenches, and walls
(p. 31-33), within 12 hexes. This spell creates a 1 hex terrain feature
every 60 combat rounds. This spell may be used prior to a battle during
set up to place 12 1-hex terrain features anywhere within 12 hexes of
the caster. Surprised armies may not move earth before battle.</p>

<p>With this spell, the caster can move large volumes of soil, even to
the point of altering the surface features of areas within range. Earth
in the area can be moved at 60’ per turn, according to the spellcaster’s
desires. The spell’s range will extend downwards through the earth until
it reaches the limit (240’) or solid rock. Move earth cannot affect
stone, only soil.</p>

<p>Ah drat. If this spell worked by <em>Volume</em> of instead of
chunks, this would be <strong><em>maximum stonks</em></strong>. </p>
<p>To illustrate, a PC could carve a 5ft by 5ft Tunnel, 2560 ft in
length <em>in a mere 10 minutes.</em> At those speeds you would be
mining 107 cubic ft. of material <em>every second. Stunningly, a PC
would be able to keep pace with the removed materials.</em> If the
tunnel described above was to be made, the depth of the hole would
increase by roughly 25.6ft after one round has passed. A PC would would
be able to be at <em>walking speed</em>  and the tunnel would build
itself before their eyes. &lt;- half that because only half of the
volume can be cleared.</p>
<p>What a neat way to expedite dwarven mining, or build rapid
fortifications for an approaching army. A maximum volume of 40 ft by 40
ft by 40ft is already a <em>huge</em> amount to work use, but it only
gets <em>even more ludicrous</em> with the full duration of this spell.
Well…. if it could cast this way. Be wary DMs.</p>

<p>Picture this: you and your party valiantly battle an adult red dragon
in its lair overlooking the towns its claimed and terrorized for
centuries. You gather the loot, earn your levels, and as you begin to
leave, realize you need some way to signify this is your lair now. What
better way is there really than making an enormous twenty foot tall
stone dick overlooking your new lands?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s kind of the extent of Move Earth. It’s at its best
as a silly giant sculpting spell, and serves otherwise niche purposes
that rarely come up.</p>
<p>Practical applications of the spell are genuinely hard to come up
with in most environments. If you’ve got time in an underground dungeon,
this can seal off an area relatively quickly which can be used to play
the long game in attempting to starve out some baddies. You could
conceivably make a wall with it to block an entrance to an underground
settlement or enclosed camp. You could excavate a space and fill it with
spikes or water and alligators, I guess. You could start a demolition
company and bring some buildings down, which is neat. Outside of that, I
don’t really see it working out.</p>
<p>You can’t use it in combat as the time it requires to move stuff
around takes too long. You need to be in an area where altering a large
chunk of terrain has an advantage, which means you need to know you’ll
be fighting there in the future. You then need to leverage the moved
area more so than the spell currently describes, as it’s difficult to
make a wall of stone all that useful, especially when you actually just
cast Wall of Stone with a lower level spell slot, and spontaneously as
an action at that.</p>
<p>The alterations you make are permanent, and do affect a large area.
If you want to build your own base or fortify a town, this spell will
give you some amount of tools to do that. In the grand scope of a
campaign, this rarely will lead to meaningful advantages, and could be
completed with a bunch of gold, some hired masons and builders, and a
quarry.</p>
<p>I want to like Move Earth, as it rewards creative thinking and future
planning. The core issue with it is the location you alter needs to be a
central focus. The other use cases can be fine, but again require you
have ample set up time to be meaningful which often you just don’t have.
Move Earth can move along as far as I’m concerned. If you’re playing an
Earthbender type character it’s a must have. Otherwise, don’t
bother.</p>
