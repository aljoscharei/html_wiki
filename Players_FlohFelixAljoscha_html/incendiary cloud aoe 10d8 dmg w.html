<h1 >Incendiary Cloud</h1>
<p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears
in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud
spreads around corners and is <a href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e
heavily obscured</a>. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of
moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses
it.<br />
When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving
throw when it enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or
ends its turn there.<br />
The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you
choose at the start of each of your turns.</p>
