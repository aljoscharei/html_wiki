<h1 >5e interacting with objects</h1>
<p>You can also interact with <strong>one</strong> object or feature of
the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For
example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a
foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to
attack.</p>
<p><a

<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your
action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an
action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities
when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>
