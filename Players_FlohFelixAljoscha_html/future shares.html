<h1 >future shares</h1>
<p>Future shares have evolved in Thistle Hold as a way to finance
adventures into the depths of Davokar. The risks are sky-high, but may

witnessed contract where investors pay coin to a high-risk enterprise
with the promise of a return of money in proportion to the
investment.</p>
