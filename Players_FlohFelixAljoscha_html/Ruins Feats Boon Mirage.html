<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Mirage</h1>
<p>You have a mystical gift and may weave momentary mirages from thin
air; flames that emit no heat jump between your hands, tiny figures of
light dance in the air, and so on. You can also weave false images over
smaller objects, for instance making pebbles appear as shining coins.
You can cast prestidigitation without gaining any Corruption.</p>
<p>With Mirage, you may make an opposed check – your Charisma
(Deception) vs their Wisdom (Insight) to dupe someone into accepting
fake goods or payment in the form of illusory coins, to a maximum
“value” of a hundred thaler. Also, Mirage can grant advantage on a
Charisma check when you threaten someone with “powerful magic.”</p>
