<h1 >Ruins of
Symbaroum Mystic Approach Self-taught Mystic</h1>
<p>You are a Self-taught mystic, excluded from the traditions, never
accepted by your peers and completely uninterested in the narrow
worldviews they offer. However, your freedom comes at a price:
Corruption is lurking around each corner and you are fair game to witch
hunters and Black Cloaks. Whether you wander from village to village or
hide in a bustling city, you probably earn your living by offering your
services as an occult consultant or a finder of misplaced objects.</p>
<p><strong>Particularly gifted individuals have always been able to bend
and break seemingly inescapable laws of nature,</strong> and many
scholars claim that it was through coalitions of such independent, or
untamed, mystics that the traditions first arose. Whether this is true
or not, there occasionally are individuals who either choose or are
forced to study on their own, or in smaller groups.</p>
<p>Independent mystics are not burdened with the theories of a
traditions, which gives them more freedom in their choice of powers.
However, they are also much more vulnerable to Corruption. Many untamed
mystics tend to evolve their own understanding of the world and come to
espouse theories that contradict those of the established
traditions.</p>
<p>Titles</p>
<p>As a Self-taught mystic, youâ€™re free to call yourself whatever you
wish, although both Ordo Magica and the Church of Prios take a very dim
view of folks who use a title that they have not earned.</p>
<p>Corruption</p>
<p>With limited access to new spells and the innate understanding of how
to use your personal focus, most self-taught mystics think of Corruption
as a secondary consideration. You <strong>do not know how to favor
spells</strong> and cannot have any favored spells or cantrips. It is
only as you gain power that the marks of Corruption become more
prominent and the watching eyes of the villagers become colder and less
trusting; then you must choose between gathering more power or more
attention. The gift of freedom is double-edged and darkness is drawn to
the gifted as envy to those with talent. The power of Corruption cuts
deep and must be kept under control; many a free mystic has accepted the
darkness although it truly is a kiss of death.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>Self-taught mystics rely on learning and then applying the inherent
principles of magic by experimentation. They use
<strong>Intelligence</strong> as their spellcasting ability modifier.
You learn spells from <strong>any of the traditions lists other than the
Theurg</strong> (see page 187 and onwards).</p>
<p>Boundless Magic</p>
<p>With your Self-taught approach, you can learn spells from any of the
given spell lists. However, you only know three cantrips and one 1st
level spell at 1st level.</p>
<p>Personal Investment</p>
<p>At 3rd level when you cast a spell you can choose to put some of your
personal power into it. You cast the spell as if it was using the
highest spell level you know but gain Corruption as if it was cast at
its base level. You then must make a Constitution saving throw against
your own spell save DC. On a failure you gain a level of <a

Conditions Exhaustion</a>.</p>
<p>Natural Alchemy</p>
<p>At 6th level, if you take a long rest in a wild area, you can prepare
a number of tonics equal to your proficiency bonus. Each tonic restores
one Hit Die when consumed. The tonics do not keep well, and lose their
effectiveness within 24 hours. <a href="potion%20of%20healing">potion of

<p>Steadfast</p>
<p>At 9th level, as a Self-taught mystic, you have learned to have both
an iron will and stomach. You can use your reaction to give yourself
advantage on a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw. You must then take a
short or longer rest before using this feature again.</p>
<p>At 13th level, when you succeed at a Constitution or Wisdom saving
throw you take no damage from the effect. If you fail the saving throw
you take half damage from the effect.</p>
<p>At 17th level, when you succeed at a Constitution or Wisdom saving
throw and the effect was caused by a spellcaster then that spellcaster
takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p>
