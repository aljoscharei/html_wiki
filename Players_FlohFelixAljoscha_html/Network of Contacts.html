<h1 >Network of Contacts</h1>
<p>As a spy, youâ€™ve built up a group of individuals that can pro- vide
you with information. You number of contacts is equal to twice your
proficiency bonus. When you first take this approach and each time your
proficiency bonus increases, you can select new contacts. You can learn
appropriate in- formation from them or arrange a meeting with a person
of that social level by meeting with your contact (see social
challenges, page 36).</p>
<p>Each belongs to one of the following types:<br />
- Alleyway Contact. This contact is in touch with the shady dealings of
a community and the lowest rungs of society. - Market Contact. This
contact is involved in the trade concerns of the community and the
middle class merchants and traders.<br />
- Noble Contact. This contact is involved in the political concerns of
the community and the machinations of the royalty and other nobles for
control of the community</p>
