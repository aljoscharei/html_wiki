<h1 >Item Lucky Coin 40 Th</h1>
<p>A gold coin instilled with energies of good fortune. The coin is
carried in a pocket and gives advantage to one ability check per short
rest. Whoever toys with such energies is at risk of suffering from the
opposite effect; if the result of the roll is a natural 20, the carrier
will have disadvantage on every ability check until they can take a
short (or longer) rest.</p>
