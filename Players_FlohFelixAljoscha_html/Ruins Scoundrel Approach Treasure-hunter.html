<h1 >Ruins Scoundrel
Approach Treasure-hunter</h1>
<p>The depths of Davokar hide many treasures; to locate, sal-vage and
return them to civilization is your bread and butter. You dream of
overgrown ruins and fantasize about sunken temples. Unlike many others,
you have proven yourself willing to risk your life in order to succeed.
You have developed an impressive set of skills in order to do just that
and there are few situations within Davokar for which you have not
prepared a strategy.</p>
