<p>MaGic circLe</p>
<p>3rd-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br />
Range: 10 feet<br />
Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at
least 50 thaler, which the spell consumes) Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy
centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing
runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or another
surface. Choose one option: a) A mystic that knows the pattern to a
permanent teleportation circle may communicate telepathically with the
attendant of that circle (see The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica on page
204). Or b) Choose one or more of the following types of creatures:
celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons. The circle affects
a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: - The creature
can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature
tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first
succeed on a Charisma saving throw. - The creature has disadvantage on
attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. - Targets within the
cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.
When you choose this option, you can elect to cause its magic to operate
in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type
from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it. - At Higher
Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the duration
increases by 1 hour for each level above 3rd.</p>
<p>The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica Each chapter of Ordo Magica has a
permanent teleportation circle and these are more or less always manned
by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach
the chapter telepathically. Telepathy is the transmission of direct
thought, with no opportunity for subtlety or dissembling, so wizards are
generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with
mystics they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues,
transmissions are kept as short as possible – on the crowded career
ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any
competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.</p>
