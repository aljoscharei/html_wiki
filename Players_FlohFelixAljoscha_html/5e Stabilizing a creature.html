<h3 >Stabilizing a Creature</h3>
<p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If
healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that
it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>
<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious
creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10
Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
<p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn’t make death saving throws,
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The
creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws
again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed
regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>
