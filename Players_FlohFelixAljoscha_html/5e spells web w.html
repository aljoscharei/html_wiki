<h1 >Web</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice
within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the
duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their
area.</p>
<p><strong>If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as
walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the
conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of
your next turn. </strong> <strong>A ball of web disappears!</strong> or
maybe it remains but is irrelevant</p>
<p>Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.<br />
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them
during its turn must make a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On
a failed save, the creature is <a href="Restrained.html">Restrained</a> as
long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.<br />
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
restrained.</p>
<p>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs (out of 64) exposed
to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature
that starts its turn in the fire.</p>
