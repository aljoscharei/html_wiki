<p>At 3rd level, you may use either your bonus action or your reaction
when a creature that can hear and understand you takes damage. You sap
their confidence using choice phrases, observations and reflections on
their character. The creature takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage and
has disadvantage on its next attack roll. Once you use this feature you
cannot use it again until your next turn.</p>
