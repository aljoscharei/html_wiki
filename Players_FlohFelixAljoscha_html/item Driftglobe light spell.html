<h1 >item Driftglobe light spell</h1>
<p>Wondrous Item, uncommon</p>
<p>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60
feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the
<a href="5e%20spells%20light%20wc%20ROS%20ritual.html">5e spells light wc
ROS ritual</a> or <a href="daylight%20c.html">daylight c</a> spell. Once
used, the <a href="daylight%20c.html">daylight c</a> effect can’t be used
again until the next dawn.</p>
<p>You can speak another command word as an action to make the
illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off
the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature
grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it
follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest
route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the
ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out. </p>
