<p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute. No: It should be a Downtime
activity. <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and
an owl feather)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of
the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you
learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created
by a spell, you learn which spell created it.<br />
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what
spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>

<p>Identifying an Artifact is a Downtime Activity of Wizards and
Artifact Crafters</p>
<p>At 3rd level you can attempt an Intelligence (<a
href="5e%20Skills%20Investigation.html">5e Skills Investigation</a>) check
to determine the <strong>properties of a magic item.</strong> On a
success, if it is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use
them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it
has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and
what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell
created it. The DC is dependent on the kind of magic item: common (DC
10), uncommon (DC 13), rare (DC 16), very rare (DC 19), legendary (DC
22). <a href="Symbaroum%20Treasure%20MOC">Symbaroum Treasure MOC</a>

>If
there is no identify spell, then how can you learn about magic
items?</h1>
<p><a href="Symbaroum%20Treasure%20MOC">Symbaroum Treasure MOC</a> - You
have to go to a scholar. - But: How does the scholar know about an item,
especially if the item was lost for milennia and there cannot be any
information transfer. - Maybe troll singers are the only way to reliably
identify the object, because the trolls will always know what it is.
Wizards can try by need a laboratory - alternatively you can spend
corruption to attune and the item will tell you.</p>
