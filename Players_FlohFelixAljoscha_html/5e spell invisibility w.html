<p>2nd-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Components: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic) Duration:
Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A single creature that you touch becomes invisible until the spell
ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as
it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks
or casts a spell.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 3rd level or
higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above
2nd.</strong></p>
<p>The fact that being Invisible has two bullet points will be extra
important in just a minute. But for now let’s take a look at the first
one. You become impossible to see–but not impossible to detect. The
noise you make and tracks you leave still give away your location.
Meaning that without a silence spell, if you cast invisibility on
yourself in combat, everyone still knows exactly where you are and can
attack you.</p>
<p>Of course, thanks to the second bullet point, anyone attacking you
has disadvantage. But that means you can still be easily included in an
area of effect, or the monk can rush across the room to try and stunning
fist you.</p>
<p>The other thing worth mentioning is that you are heavily obscured for
the purpose of hiding. That’s a mechanical way of representing the fact
that you can’t be seen. And more importantly, it means you can hide
without having to obscure your position from someone <a
href="202202101906%205e%20Actions%20in%20Combat%20Hide.html">202202101906
5e Actions in Combat Hide</a>. Normally if you want to hide in combat
you have to get out of sight of the creature you’re hiding from. You
can’t just be in a corridor and shout <em>stealth check!</em> at your
DM. Unless you’re invisible, that is. This goes for enemies too. If a
spellcaster vanishes right in front of you with invisibility? You still
know exactly where they are until they make that hide check. Noise,
footprints, and the like give them away.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes no sense. If you can see, you don’t have
disadvantage.</li>
<li>But what if you want to counter that advantage? That’s when
invisibility gets real weird.
<ul>
<li>Because invisibility isn’t just about not being seen. It’s also
about getting advantage and giving your enemies disadvantage on attack
rolls in combat. For normal invisibility, it’s most often about the
defensive uses of it. It all comes down to that second bullet point. In
a big Sage Advice Live panel last year, D&amp;D’s lead rules designer,
Jeremy Crawford broke it down: In a nutshell, even being able to see an
invisible creature with magic doesn’t negate the second bullet point.
You need a spell like Faerie Fire which <em>specifically</em> says it
negates the benefit of being invisible.</li>
<li>Faerie Fire is one of the only spells that does this. <a
href="see_invisibility%20w.html">see_invisibility w</a> doesn’t. Even <a
href="true%20seeing%20illusions%20wc.html">true seeing illusions wc</a>,
the most powerful Illusion piercing spell in the game, doesn’t do this.
Same goes for creatures and characters that naturally have <a
href="5e%20Blindsight.html">5e Blindsight</a>. This leads to the odd
occasion of fighting a Gelatinous Cube (which has blindsight) and it
still having disadvantage to attack the invisible character, but not the
non-invisible person trying to hide next to them.</li>
<li>So being able to see an invisible person looks like the
<strong>predator</strong>.</li>
<li>So to sum up? If you’re invisible you can run and you <em>can</em>
hide, but unless you do, everyone knows where you are. But even if they
can see you, they still can’t hit you.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
