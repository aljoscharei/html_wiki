<h1 >Fire Shield</h1>
<p><em>4th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a
firefly)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding
bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss
it.<br />
The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you
choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the
chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.<br />
In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a
melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire
damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.</p>
