<h1 >Goblin Backgrounds Labourer</h1>
<p>Laborer</p>
<p>You are a daily worker, tolerated in town during the day as you work
but then forced to take your rest in either a central resting area or
outside the village. Think about the kind of work that you might do? Do
you have any friends inside town? Do you have a hated enemy among the
other laborers? Are you saving your scant coin for the future, or do you
spend it on drink and entertainment as soon as you get it?</p>

tools</li>
<li>Equipment:A kit to match your tool proficiency, thick working
clothes and 1d6 + 4 shillings.</li>

<p>Suggested Characteristics Laborers are one of the lowest members of
society and are often ill-treated. They are also easily ignored, and a
quick-eared and quick-witted person can learn much while they work.</p>
<p>Personality Trait 1. I make friends easily, I don’t have time or
energy to fight anyone unless they truly do me wrong. 2. I like to be
proud of my work and am sensitive to critique. 3. I like farm (or work)
animals more than most people. They’re more trustworthy. 4. I don’t care
about the work much, but there is someone who matters to me here. 5.
I’ve heard rumors of great opportunities outside of the village and
yearn to leave. 6. This is just a job and I look forward to when I don’t
need to work anymore. 7. I don’t understand humans very well at all, but
I do like money and food. 8. I heard a human say ‘work hard, play hard’
once. That’s my motto now.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Tradition. My family has always worked here. I feel
obligated to my employers, at least for now. 2. Opportunity. It’s my
right to try my own way, even if it fails. 3. Work. When I’m bored I get
in much more trouble. 4. Entertainment. I do almost everything I do for
my own sense of fun or to make others laugh. 5. Pride. I can say that
I’ve accomplished something when I go to the forest to die. 6. Humor.
What is the point of life if you can’t laugh?</p>
<p>Bond 1. I’ll take any amount of punishment to keep my fellow workers
out of trouble. 2. I had one old hand who showed me the ropes. I wonder
where they are now? 3. I trust my new friends, much more than my old
ones. 4. I actually feel something towards my employers. They’re nicer
than most humans. 5. I used to have a great love, but they had to leave
long ago. I miss them. 6. I have a tool that has been with me forever, I
think of it as a good luck charm.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I’m so used to meanness that if you show me a kindness I’ll
take it too far. 2. I’m not really one for plans, or planning, or
following instructions exactly. 3. I’m often petty and direct my
frustration at those who can do nothing about it. 4. I really don’t
understand that other peoples don’t share our sense of humor or
tolerance for pain. 5. There is no reason to argue today about what I
did yesterday. 6. I get distracted by grandiose plans sometimes.
Alright, all the time. So listen, I have this idea…</p>
