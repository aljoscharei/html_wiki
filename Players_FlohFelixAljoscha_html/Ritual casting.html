<h1 >Ritual casting</h1>
<p>At 2nd level, - you may choose a spell that you do not already know
that is on your mystic approach spell list, has the ritual tag, and does
not exceed your current maximum spell level. - If you do so, you gain
permanent Corruption (see page 37) equal to half the spell level,
rounded up. If the ritual is a cantrip, you gain no permanent
Corruption. - You can only cast the chosen spell as a ritual â€“ the
ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal
and can only be cast at its base level. You gain no Corruption from
casting one of these spells. - You may also learn another spell as a
ritual using these rules at 5th, 7th, 11th and 14th level.</p>
