<h1 >Precise Strike</h1>
<p>When you reach 13th level, your ranged weapon accuracy is such that
you can disarm a creature with a shot. Use your bonus action when making
an attack to attempt a precise strike; on a hit you donâ€™t do any damage
but the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your attack
roll result or drop what it is holding.</p>
