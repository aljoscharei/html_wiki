<h1 >Strength</h1>
<p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to
which you can exert raw physical force.</p>
<h2 >Strength Checks</h2>
<p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply
brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in
certain kinds of Strength checks.</p>

<p><strong>Other Strength Checks.</strong> The GM might also call for a
Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
<li>Break free of bonds</li>
<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
<li>Tip over a statue</li>
<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
</ul>
<h2 >Attack Rolls and Damage</h2>
<p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or
a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>
<h2 >Lifting and Carrying</h2>
<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The
following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your
Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you
can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have
to worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a
weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your
Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your
carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more
weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category
above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it
can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>
