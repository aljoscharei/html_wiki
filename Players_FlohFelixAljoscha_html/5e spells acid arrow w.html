<h1 >Acid Arrow</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an
adder’s stomach)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and
bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4
acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes
the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no
damage at the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later)
increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/acid-arrow &gt; On the
surface, Acid Arrow is your standard damage dealing spell. 4d4 points of
damage isn’t too shabby for a second level spell, but it’s nothing to
sing songs about either. It’s also nice that you can do at least a
little bit of damage even if you miss. &gt; What separates Acid Arrow
from other similar spells, however, is the delayed damage. &gt; How can
we leverage that to our advantage? There are a few different ways I can
think of off the top of my head. &gt; Use it to break enemy
spellcasters’ <strong>concentration</strong>. Even if they maintain it
the first time, you’ve got one more bite at the apple even if you choose
a different target with your next turn. &gt; Take one last shot at
enemies who are running away. Just when they think they’re free and
clear, their face melts off. Joke’s on them! &gt; If you’re only a hit
point or two away from being taken out of the fight, you might take some
satisfaction in knowing you’re going to get one last attack in after you
fall unconscious or die. &gt; It’s also worth noting that the spell
description doesn’t say that you need to target creatures with this
spell. Use it to dissolve a rope, ruin a painting, or polish your
silverware.</p>
