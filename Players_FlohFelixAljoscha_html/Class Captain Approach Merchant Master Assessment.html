<h1 >Class Captain
Approach Merchant Master Assessment</h1>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>As an action, you can observe a creature and make a DC 10 Wisdom
(Insight) check to notice a weakness that you might exploit. With a
success:<br />
- If you make an attack roll against the creature you have advantage.
Once you make a successful attack roll, you no longer have advantage due
to this feature. - If you make a contested ability check,you have
advantage on the roll. If you succeed at the check, you no longer have
advantage due to this feature.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can assess an object instead. Make a DC 10
Intelligence (Investigation) check. You must be able to see and handle
the object. On a success, the GM will answer one of these questions
(your choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately how old is this object?</li>
<li>Approximately how valuable is this object?</li>
<li>Who is most likely to have made this object?</li>
<li>What is the most likely purpose for this object?</li>
</ul>
<p>After using this feature on a creature or object you must take an
extended rest before using this feature again on the same creature or
object. You canâ€™t detect magic, but might suspect it based on appearance
or origin. At 9th level, you can assess a creature or object using your
bonus action instead.</p>
