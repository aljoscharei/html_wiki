<h1 >Cover</h1>
<p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during
combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit
from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the
opposite side of the cover.</p>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple
sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the
degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a
creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives
three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>
<p>A target with <strong><a href="half%20cover.html">half
cover</a></strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A
target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.
The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a
friend.</p>
<p>A target with <a href="three-quarters%20cover.html">three-quarters
cover</a> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has
three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an
obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick
tree trunk.</p>
<p>A target with <strong><a href="total%20cover.html">total
cover</a></strong> can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell,
although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area
of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an
obstacle.</p>
<h3 >How to Abjudicate Cover
on a Battle map?</h3>
<p>To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other
effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker’s space or the point
of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines from that
corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or
two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another
creature), the target has <a href="half%20cover.html">half cover</a>. If
three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach
the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit), the target
has <a href="three-quarters%20cover.html">three-quarters cover</a></p>
<p>On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing lines between the
corners of the hexagons. The target has half cover if up to three lines
are blocked by an obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more
lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target.</p>
<p>so if up to half of the lines are blocked the target has half cover,
if more than half are blocked three-quarters cover <img
