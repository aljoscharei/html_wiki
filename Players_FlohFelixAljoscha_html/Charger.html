<p>When you use your action to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash">Dash</a>,
you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#ShovingaCreature">shove</a>
a creature.</p>
<p>If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before
taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attackâ€™s
damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the
target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#ShovingaCreature">shove</a>
and you succeed).</p>
