number of Combat dice (d6) equal to your pro- ficiency bonus. On your
turn you can use a bonus action to add a Combat die to your spell attack
roll or your spell damage. You can use your reaction to add a Combat die
to a saving throw to maintain concentration.<br />
You regain any spent Combat dice when you take a short or longer
rest.</p>
