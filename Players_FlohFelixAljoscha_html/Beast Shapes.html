<h1 >Beast Shapes</h1>
<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half
your mystic level (rounded down). You can then expend another use of
this feature to remain in the beast shape. You can revert to your normal
form as a bonus action and you automatically revert if you fall
unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply: - Your game
statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain
your personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in
addition to gaining those of the crea- ture. If the creature has the
same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than
yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has
any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. - When you transform,
you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your
normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you
transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit
points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example,
if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you
revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce
your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. - You
can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that
requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a
spell, such as eyebite, that you’ve already cast. - You retain the
benefit of any features from your class, origin, or other source and can
use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you
can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your
new form also has that sense.<br />
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to
wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your
equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any
equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or
merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until
you leave the form. <img src="Witch%20Beast%20Shapes.png"
