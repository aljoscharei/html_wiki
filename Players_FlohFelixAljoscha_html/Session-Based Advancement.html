<h1 >Session-Based Advancement</h1>
<p>A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach
2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another
session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three
sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate
of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.</p>
