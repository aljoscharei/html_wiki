<p>You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like,
including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice,
hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You
can make yourself appear as a member of another origin, though none of
your statistics change. You can only appear as a creature of the same
size category as you, and your basic shape stays the same; you canâ€™t use
this effect to become quadrupedal, for instance. The effect ends at
dawn, but you can use this effect again after a short or longer rest, so
that you can continue the disguise as needed.Suspicious folk might
reveal the truth by making a Wisdom (Insight) vs Charisma (Deception)
check.</p>
