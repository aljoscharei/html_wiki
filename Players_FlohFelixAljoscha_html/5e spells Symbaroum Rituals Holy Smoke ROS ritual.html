<p>You light incense and choose a 10-foot cube within range. The smoke
spreads among those present and gathers around objects and creatures in
relation to how corrupted they are: the closer the smoke gathers, the
more tainted the creature in question is. The Gamemaster clearly states
if objects or creatures are blight-stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly
corrupt. (See Corruption, page 38).</p>
<p>Holy smoke can be countered by the exchange shadow spell.</p>
