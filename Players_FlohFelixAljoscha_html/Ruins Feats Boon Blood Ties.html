You have established a mystical blood tie to a creature of a different
origin. Because of this link, you can later on choose a feat belonging
to the origin of the blood-friend (see page 153). It is most likely that
the blood tie of the character is linked to another cultural origin, but
beasts and other creatures are a possibility. The story of how the
character came to enter into the relationship is probably interesting
and telling of your life history, and maybe also of your morals and
worldviews.</p>
