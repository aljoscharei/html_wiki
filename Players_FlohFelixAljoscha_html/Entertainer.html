<p>You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them,
entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts
of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your
music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps
captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use,
your art is your life.</p>

By Popular Demand</h4>
<p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern
but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court. At
such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or
comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as
long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you
something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town
where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an
audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful
personalities. They’re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to
high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of
beauty.</p>

Entertainer: Gladiator</h4>
<p>A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus
performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd
can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine,
though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your
By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place
that features combat for entertainment — perhaps a gladiatorial arena or
secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your
equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a
trident or net.</p>
