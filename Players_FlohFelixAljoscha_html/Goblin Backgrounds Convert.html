<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>Goblin converts exist in two worlds: they are still goblins, with
short lifespans and a particular sense of humor, but they have been
taught the ways of Prios and some of them see his teachings as a great
opportunity for them to gain status in the new kingdom.</p>
<p>Personality Trait 1. I repeat back things that you say to me. I’m not
trying to be annoying, I want to make sure I understand. 2. Let me tell
you about all the great things I have learned from the Church! 3. I
think that everyone should be given the chances I was. 4. The Church
provides all the answers, even to questions I didn’t know I had. 5. I’m
always frowning and being very serious. I am trying hard to not be a
goblin, in other words. 6. I am very open-minded. If my teachers could
accept me, I can accept anyone. 7. I go to sleep every night with many
doubts and fears in my mind. 8. I make jokes on Prios’ behalf; I know he
has a sense of humor. Just look at me.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Faith. I am truly devoted to the Giver of Laws and have no
pretenses about my beliefs. 2. The Word. What is written cannot be
changed or undone. That is power. 3. The Sun. The day-star seems
permanent and untouchable, like a god itself. 4. Power. The humans say
that the Sun God is the chief god now. The humans have many victories to
prove this, so I choose to believe them. 5. Truth. I think everyone
should be honest. Lies dishonor the Lawgiver. 6. Followership. I am not
a leader, but I find worthy leaders and do their bidding.</p>
<p>Bond 1. I would do anything to keep my teachers safe. Despite my new
life, I still remember my family. 2. I carry my primer from when I first
learned to read and write still. It is a reminder of how far I have
come. 3. I feel like I have a personal connection to Prios. 4. I have a
huge regret from my earlier life and would do almost anything to set it
right. 5. I am obsessed with a member of the church, perhaps even a
member of the Black Cloaks.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I am a passionate believer and often seek to prove others
have less faith than me by pointing out minor errors in their prayers or
other rituals. 2. Deep down inside, I still wonder if this is real. 3. I
tend to be easily swayed by those who profess to share my beliefs. 4. I
am suspicious of my human teachers. Why are they so nice to me? 5. I’m
only pretending and going through the motions. 6. I am dismissive of
unbelievers and other strangers.</p>
