<h1 >Feint</h1>
<p>You have developed techniques for feinting – handling a weapon in
both a discreet and confusing manner. You must be wielding a weapon with
the finesse property to use these features. <a

<p>At 1st level you can use your bonus action to intentionally leave an
opening free in your defense to take advantage of later. Until your next
turn, when an opponent attacks you they have advantage on the attack but
you can use your reaction to make an attack roll immediately after their
attack. Attackers lose advantage once you use your reaction.</p>
<p>At 6th level, you can use your bonus action to make a feint against
an opponent. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against an
opponent’s armor class. If successful, you have advantage on attacks
against that opponent until the end of your turn.</p>
