<p>The subject of this spell can fly in any direction at a speed of up
to 120’ per round (360’ per turn). Flying under the effect of this spell
requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can
attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell cannot carry
aloft more weight than his maximum load. If a fly spell is dispelled,
the subject will plummet from the air.</p>
