<h1 >Ruins Warrior Approach
Templar</h1>
<p>The church of Prios and its representatives are protected by the
Knights of the Dying Sun, heavily armed and with the fire of faith
burning behind their breastplates. The power of faith makes the armor of
the sun knights harder than steel. Their mere presence repels
abominations by the sheer radiance of their conviction or by weapons
burning with Prios’ holy rage.</p>
<p>Lately, a schism is said to have grown between the commander of the
Templars and the Church’s Curia in Tem- plewall. Initially, the dispute
was about how to handle the ancient sun temple found close to Karvosti,
but apparently there are other ideological differences between the
Knights of the Dying Sun and the Sun Church in general. What will come
of this conflict is not easily guessed; some dismiss it as a natural
effect of the Church’s development, others whisper of a possible
division of the Church, in line with the conflicting views that exist
regarding the dying Prios and humanity’s role in the drama.</p>
