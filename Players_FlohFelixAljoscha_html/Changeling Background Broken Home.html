<h1 >Changeling Background Broken
Home</h1>
<p>When you were revealed to be a changeling it tore your family apart.
Everyone seems to blame you (even you sometimes blame yourself, although
in your moments of clarity you realize that you never had a choice in
the matter). Still, you move forward, taking what solace you can in a
new, found family of your friends.</p>

<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>Many folks have turned away from you. Your disappointment in them has
given you a rock-hard sense of independence and a desire to learn more
about where you come from.</p>
<p>Personality 1. I am curious about everything elven, changeling or
Iron Pact-related. 2. I am cautious, always expecting people to abandon
or turn on me. 3. I can’t handle praise, something bad will surely
follow! 4. I keep a bug out bag nearby at all times, always prepared to
run. 5. I will likely do the opposite of what people expect me to do,
just to show who runs my life. 6. I prefer animals to other supposedly
“intelligent” creatures. 7. I speak my mind, no matter what. 8. I am
thankful for the smallest things, everything is better than where I come
from.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Independence. I was left here to my own devices, and I will
follow my own path through life. 2. Friendship. The world is horrible,
close friends are all you can count on. 3. Passion. Our feelings are
both the compass and the destination. 4. Truth. My childhood was a lie,
but my life won’t be. 5. Wealth. The wealthy rule the world, and I will
be one of them. 6. Kindness. No one can make it without help from
others.</p>
<p>Bond 1. Someone saved me from the mob. I am forever bound to this
person. 2. I seek the elf who swapped me for who I should have been. I
will demand an explanation. 3. Somewhere out there is a human who’s
childhood I lived. We must meet to become whole. 4. One of my ‘human
family’ did not give up on me even when my true heritage was revealed.
5. I am a dedicated member of one of the world’s factions; I cannot
imagine living without them. 6. I am sworn to help and protect
changelings everywhere.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I don’t really trust anyone, and I assume they will leave me
when I need them most. 2. Humans are no longer worth my time. 3. I
abandoned my earlier “friends,” and they are now out to get me. 4. I’ve
always felt different and special, now I know why. 5. I despise elves
and enjoy seeing them struggle. 6. I am envious of those who have more
than me in life.</p>
