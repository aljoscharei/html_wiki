<p>Crossbow, hand. Among the thieves and gangs of Yn- daros, a smaller
and more easily concealed version of the crossbow is used. It can be
held and fired in one hand, but requires two to load and has nearly the
same punch as the standard crossbow. Assassins often apply poison to the
bolts, making the weapon very effective for its size.</p>
