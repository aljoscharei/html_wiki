<h1 >Stunning Blows</h1>
<p>At 17th level, your attacks are designed to bring a foe down without
killing them. Use your bonus action when making an attack roll; on a
hit, instead of doing damage, the target must make a Constitution saving
throw against the attack roll total. On a failure it becomes stunned.
The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, end- ing the effect on a success.</p>
