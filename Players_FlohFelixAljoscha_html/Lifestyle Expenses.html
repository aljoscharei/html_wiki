<p><a href="expenses%20and%20services%20food%20spells.html">expenses and
services food spells</a> Between adventures, you choose a particular
quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your
character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and
groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic
lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the
city than if you live in poverty.</p>

<h2 >Lifestyle Expenses</h2>
<p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the
cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food
and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover
the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when
adventure next calls.</p>
<p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle
from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The
prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your
chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by
30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same
lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p>
<p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy
lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful,
though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally
might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful
connections.</p>

<p><strong>in Ruins of Symbaroum prices/day are half of
that</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no
place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns,
huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better
off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence,
disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people
covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a
fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most
people.</p>
<p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored
hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst
part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a
desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease,
hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and
you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have
suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as
exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>
<p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the
comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,
threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a
sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations
might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with
violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be
unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and
other disreputable types.</p>
<p><strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the
slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an
older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple.
You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if
simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with
families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means
that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your
equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or
in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled
tradespeople, and military officers.</p>
<p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a
life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status
associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a
lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored
servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have
respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or
a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of
servants.</p>
<p><strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort.
You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the
community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the
nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best
restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have
servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the
social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the
company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You
must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The
wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into
political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>
<h3 >Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are
spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of
whatever services you can afford–paying for food and shelter, paying
townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some
characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from
civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging,
and repairing their own gear.</p>
<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any
coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between
adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the
equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>
