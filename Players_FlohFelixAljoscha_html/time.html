<h1 >Time</h1>
<p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is
important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use
a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at
hand.</p>
<p>In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a
scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep
down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at
the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond
for anything interesting or valuable. Ten minutes are also called a <a

<p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often
more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the
heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four
hours’ time. The day of overland Travel is divided into such 4-hour
Watches. <a href="watch.html">watch</a></p>
<p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best.
Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers
spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their
journey.</p>
<p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on
<strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time. <a
href="combat%20round.html">combat round</a>. A <a
href="combat%20round.html">combat round</a>represents about 6 seconds in
the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <a
href="combat%20turn.html">combat turn</a>. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls
initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>
