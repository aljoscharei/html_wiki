<h1 >5e Dim light</h1>
<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly
obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a
source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The
soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly
brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>
