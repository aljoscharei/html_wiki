<h1 >Turn Undead</h1>
<p>Atou can use the power of the Lawgiver to rebuke the undying. As an
action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the
undead. Each undead within 30 feet of you that can see and/or hear you
must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the
creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes any damage. <a href="turned%20undead.html">turned undead</a> You can
perform this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before
needing to take a long or extended rest.</p>
<p>only <a

Symbaroum Mystic Approach Theurg</a>: At 9th level, any affected undead
with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half your proficiency
bonus (rounded down) are destroyed instead of turned. Player characters
of the undead origin do not have a challenge rating and cannot be
destroyed by this feature, though they can be turned.</p>
