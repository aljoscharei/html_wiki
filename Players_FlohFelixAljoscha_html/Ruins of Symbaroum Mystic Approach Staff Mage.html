<h1 >Ruins of
Symbaroum Mystic Approach Staff Mage</h1>
<p>Titles</p>
<p>The order of Staff Mages has three titles: Staffless (appren- tices;
i.e. established mystics who train with the order but have yet to earn a
staff ), Rune Staff (those who have received a staff ) and finally the
Staff Masters.</p>
<p>Corruption</p>
<p>The order teaches that Corruption is a side-effect of the negligent
exercise of power. Mages do not regard Cor- ruption as immoral in
itself, but emphasize that the Cor- ruption of the mystic can become the
enemy’s weapon; all mages are taught that Sorcerers can use the mage’s
own Corruption against him or her, which is why Corruption must be
avoided.</p>
<p>The order also keeps older and darker lessons alive, les- sons that
claim the careless use of mystical powers, rituals and artifacts not
only affect the mystic who wields them, but also the surrounding world.
As proof of this, they often refer to the deserted wasteland east of the
Ravens – which at one time is said to have been flourishing farmlands
and the cradle of humankind’s first empire. And since the order,
according to the mages, stems from the east, it is not unlikely that
their moral tales on the importance of mystical restraint contain some
grains of truth.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>Staff Mages use arcane hand gestures and the movement of their staff
to draw forth their magical energies and di- rect them. You use
Intelligence as your spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells
from the Wizard tradition list.</p>
<p>The staff mage does not need to attune to their rune staff, it is an
integral part of their magical practice and uses your own internal
energy.</p>
<p>Bonus Spell</p>
<p>At 1st level, you learn the detect magic spell in addition to your
chosen spells.</p>
<p>Staff Fighting</p>
<p>At 1st level, the staff mage is proficient with the rune staff, which
provides the following benefits:<br />
• +1 to AC when unarmored.<br />
• Therunestaffcountsasafinessequarterstaffthatweighs</p>
<p>3 lbs.</p>
<p>At 6th level, the staff mage gains the following benefits for their
rune staff:<br />
• The staff is considered magical for the purposes of mag-</p>
<p>ical weapons and armor. The rune staff gains a +1 bonus</p>
<p>to attack and damage rolls.<br />
• You can use your bonus action to make an attack with</p>
<p>your rune staff.</p>
<p>At 13th level, the rune staff gains these additional effects: • The
staff now provides a +2 bonus to AC, as well as on</p>
<p>attack and damage rolls.<br />

rune staff:<br />

<ul>
<li><p>When the staff mage gains a point of permanent Cor-</p>
<p>ruption they can assign it to the rune staff instead of themselves.
Once the rune staff already has three or more permanent Corruption, each
time you add a point of per- manent Corruption to the staff, roll a d20.
If the result is equal to or lower than the new total of permanent Cor-
ruption held by the staff then the staff splits asunder and you gain the
staff ’s permanent Corruption immediately. Creating a new staff requires
an extended rest.</p></li>
<li><p>The mage can use their bonus action to activate an ele- mental
rune on the staff and add 1d4 damage to a single damage roll using the
staff. The additional damage is your choice of acid, cold, fire, or
lightning.</p>

elemental damage rises to 1d8.<br />

total, rounded down. You gain no Corruption from casting this spell.</p>
