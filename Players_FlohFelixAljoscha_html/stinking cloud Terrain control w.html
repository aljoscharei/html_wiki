<h1 >Stinking Cloud</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk
cabbage leaves)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered
on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area
is <a href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e heavily obscured</a>. The
cloud lingers in the air for the duration.<br />
Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its
turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed
save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.
Creatures that donâ€™t need to breathe or are immune to poison
automatically succeed on this saving throw.<br />
A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4
rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1
round. <a href="cloudkill%20terrain%20control%20w.html">cloudkill terrain

This spell creates a cloud of foul-smelling vapors in a hex adjacent to
the caster. A unit within the affected hex must make a successful saving
throw versus Poison or be helpless due to nausea. The unit remains
helpless for 1d4+1 rounds +1 round per level of the caster. If the unit
succeeds on its saving throw, it immediately retreats one hex towards
its own map edge. If it cannot retreat, it is helpless. A helpless unit
cannot be activated. The stinking cloud blocks line of sight into or
through the affected hex.</p>
