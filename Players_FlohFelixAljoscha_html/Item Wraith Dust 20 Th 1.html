<h1 >Item Wraith Dust 20 Th 1</h1>
<p>Wraith dust forces an incorporeal being to take physical form for the
next 10 minutes. The dust must be thrown (range 5/15) at a target. While
corporeal the spirit takes damage as living creatures do (it loses any
resistances or immunities during this time).</p>
