<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens
Bloodthirst</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +2 to Strength<br />
You have a thirst for blood, easily awoken and hard to quench. The
thirst appears if you take damage and means that you will not spare any
enemies – not even if they surrender. Trying to spare an enemy requires
an almost overpowering effort; you must succeed at a DC 20 Wisdom saving
throw.</p>
