<h1 >Blight</h1>
<p><em>4th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can
see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target
must make a <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong>. The target takes
8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.<br />
If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving
throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.<br />
If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree
or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and
dies.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 4th.</p>
<p>It competes with Dimension Door, Banishment… and Polymorph, and
Greater Invisibility, and Freedom of Movement, and Wall of Fire, and
Conjure Woodland Beings…</p>
<p>The thing is, damage is rarely the best use for a spell. Fireball, at
least, is an AoE, so it has the use of clearing out large group of weak
enemies. But 8D8 damage of a fairly commonly resisted damage type on a
single enemy isn’t going to turn a fight around. Not as hard as simply
taking said enemy out of the fight entirely with Banishment or turning
an ally into a giant ape, at least.</p>
<h1 >Reddit sais:</h1>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/muxzi9/why_do_people_say_blight_is_bad/</p>
<p>We just got 7th level, and my friend said that Blight is a bad spell.
When I asked why they said they just heard it somewhere. What I’m
wanting to know is that is the spell really that bad?</p>
<p>For a 4th level spell, 8d8 damage isn’t that bad right? That’s a
higher average and maximum than Fireball! It is a constitution save, but
they still take half damage on a success. Most creatures at this level
are not plants. However, in the chance there is a plant, you instakill
the creature as just a nice bonus. My only guess is that it’s competing
with spells like Dimension Door or Banishment. Also the caveat of no
undead or constructs might hurt, but we mostly face humanoids in our
campaign.</p>

<p>Because there’s a belief that spell-casters are most effective by
providing control effects.</p>
<p>Dealing damage is the one thing martials are better at than
spell-casters. So a) you should let them do that and b) you should do
something they can’t (which is battlefield control).</p>
<p>From that perspective, it’s not that Blight is a bad damage spell.
It’s that damage spells are “bad”.</p>
<p>Big AoE effects are an exception to that, which is why Fireball
usually get’s a pass (and it’s overtuned on purpose).</p>
<hr />
<p>8d8 damage is on average 36 damage on a single target. That’s damage
that a decently built martial character at 7th level can put out in one
turn. Why would 7th level caster use their highest level spell slot to
do this? If you hit two targets with a 3rd level fireball, you outdamage
blight easily. Simply put, doing 36 damage on average isn’t enough of an
impact for a 4th level spell slot.</p>
<p>Con saves are usually the worst to target. On average, con saves are
the highest on enemies. And then there are also two creature types
completely immune to this. So on top of not being a very impactful
spell, it’s also not very reliable.</p>
<p>There’s some really powerful fourth levels spells. For example:
Conjure woodland beings, evard’s black tentacles, dimension door,
greater invisibility, banishment and polymorph. Any of these will easily
have more of an impact than blight will.</p>
<hr />
<p>Barbarian</p>
<p>I suppose because, unlike Fireball, and unlike all other 4th level
spells, it only deals damage to a single target, <em>and</em> it has no
additional affects.</p>
<p>I tried looking for a 4th level spell that just dealt damage, but I
couldn’t find any. All other spells deal less damage, yeah, but it’s
either AOE, comes with an additional useful effect, or both.</p>
<p>If you need damage, it’s good, even though CON is the highest ability
score on average in D&amp;D, but most of the time you’re going to want
that AOE or those additional effects.</p>
<hr />
<p>Warlock</p>
<p>We can compare it to Hellish Rebuke for warlocks.</p>
<p>Cast at 4th level it deals 5d10 = 27.5 damage compared to Blight’s
8d8 = 36.</p>
<p>Hellish Rebuke is a reaction, however, so it functionally deals
higher damage equal to the Warlock’s regular attack. Using Eldritch
Blast that grants an additional 2d10 = 11 worth of damage, bringing the
total to 38.5 damage, 2.5 higher than <em>Blight</em>. This difference
becomes even more severe if you account for Constitution being a strong
save, and if the Warlock takes Agonizing Blast.</p>
<hr />
<p>For a Wizard you can compare it to <em>Ice Storm</em> which does 2d8
less damage but is an AoE and provides area control.</p>

<li><p>It’s not AOE, so the thing about not hurting undead and
constructs is a limitation.</p></li>
