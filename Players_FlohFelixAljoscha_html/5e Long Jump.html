<h1 >5e Long Jump</h1>
<p>When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your
Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before
the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot
of movement.</p>
<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such
as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must
succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle
(no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or
low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>
<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land
prone.</p>

<p>What happens when a jump spell gives a creature a jump distance
greater than its walking speed? Your jump is limited by how far you can
move; each foot jumped uses a foot of movement. You can take the Dash
action if you want to extend how far you can move on your turn.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a Strength score of 15, you can normally
leap 15 feet when you make a long jump if you move at least 10 feet
immediately beforehand. If the jump spell is cast on you, that potential
jump distance is tripled. That’s a jump of 45 feet! If your speed is 30
feet, you can use only 30 feet of that jump distance on your turn,
unless you take the Dash action, which allows you to leap the full 45
feet.</p>
