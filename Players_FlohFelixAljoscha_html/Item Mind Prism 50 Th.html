<h1 >Item Mind Prism 50 Th</h1>
<p>The illusionists of Ordo Magica often use a prism to describe how the
perception of reality may be broken down and understood. Some of these
crystals are filled with so much suggestive energy that using the stone
when casting an illusion improves it so much that when a viewer makes an
ability check to detect the illusion it is at disadvantage. The caster
must take a long or extended rest before using the stone again.</p>
