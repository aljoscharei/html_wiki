<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon False
Identity</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
You have a false identity, complete with clothes, equipment and papers
to back it up. The identity is so well-crafted that it cannot be exposed
unless the person who created it (usually a prominent member of the
organization or faction to which the character belongs) discloses it –
or if you do something clearly revealing.</p>
