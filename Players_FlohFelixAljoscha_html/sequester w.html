<h1 >Sequester</h1>
<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond,
emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the
spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and
touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by
divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by
divination spells.<br />
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended
animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.<br />
You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be
anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of
the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque
awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>
