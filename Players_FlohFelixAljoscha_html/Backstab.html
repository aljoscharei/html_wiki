<h1 >Backstab</h1>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a
foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
one creature you hit with a melee weapon attack if you have advantage on
the attack roll. You must be proficient with the weapon used.</p>
<p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t inca- pacitated, and you
don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this
class, as shown in the Backstab column of the Scoundrel table.</p>
