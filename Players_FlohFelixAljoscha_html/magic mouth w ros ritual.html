<h1 >Magic Mouth</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade
dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is
uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can
see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak
the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered
over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.<br />
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and
recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If
the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth
(for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so
that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast
this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or
it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.<br />
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur
within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth
to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a
silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.</p>
<p>This could be a way for a singer to project its songs remotely. Sth

not work if worn or carried: like with magic items and mage hand, people
seem to have an aura that prevents magic somehow.</h3>
