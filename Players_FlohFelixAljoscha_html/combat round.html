<h1 >combat round</h1>
<p>A <strong><a href="combat%20round.html">combat round</a></strong>
represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each
participant in a battle takes a <strong><a
href="combat%20turn.html">combat turn</a></strong>. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls
initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>
