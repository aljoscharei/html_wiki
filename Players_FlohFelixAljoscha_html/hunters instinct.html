<p>Starting at 2nd level, if you don’t already have a chosen target, you
can use a bonus action on your turn to mark one creature as your chosen
target. The first time you do damage to the creature on your turn add
your proficiency bonus as damage (using the same type of damage as your
weapon). If you are wielding a ranged weapon, you can use your reaction
to make an attack when the creature uses its own movement, counting the
range from the creature’s starting position.</p>
