<li>The character is one of those who are arrogant or desperate enough
to cling to the darkness. While other mystical traditions do everything
they can to avoid the soul-eroding powers of Corruption, the Sorcerer
chooses to do the opposite.</li>
<li>The legends are teeming with sorcerers: <strong>mystics who draw
their power from musty wellsprings or gain their corrupt gifts from
creatures of evil</strong>.
<ul>
<li>WHAT COULD SUCH A MUSTY WELLSPRING BE?
<ul>
<li>HUMAN SACRIFICE?</li>
<li>DEMON-BLOOD</li>
<li>CORRUPTION ITSELF? HOW COULD THIS BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE RULES AND
GAME WORLD -&gt; THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANIC TO DRAW POWER FROM <a
href="Ruins%20of%20Symbaroum%20Corruption.html">Ruins of Symbaroum
Corruption</a> ITSELF</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>HOW CAN I SHOW THAT SORCERY IS A TRADITION FROM SYMBAROUM?</li>
<li>It is harder to find them in the real world, but those who know how
to read the Shadows can sense their presence or see traces of their
tainted work. Korinthia’s people faced the undead servants of the Dark
Lords during The Great War, and while the Dark Lords perished, their
parasitic powers continued to drain the life out of Alberetor, forcing
the Ambrians to flee north. There they instead faced the blighted
creatures of Davokar, born from another kind of evil that festers in the
fallen ruins of ancient Symbaroum.</li>
<li>Sorcery is the mystical tradition that comprises powers and rituals
<strong>fueled by Corruption</strong> and taint, whose usage provides
power in the short run, but corrodes the mystic’s body and soul in the
long run. Theurgs active among the Twilight Friars gather rituals of
sorcery as well as blight-stricken artifacts in an attempt to understand
this new, dark enemy. Within their monastery in the Titans, it is said
that the Black Cloaks hide dark vaults oozing with <strong>corruptive
energies</strong> and echoing with the lamentations of the poor, tainted
souls kept there for study.</li>
</ul>
<p>Titles</p>
<p>Would-be Sorcerers begin as either lowly members of another
Sorcerer’s cult, desperately believing that if they please their master
then they will be rewarded with power. And, sometimes, this may be true,
though most cult members are only useful to their leader as scapegoats
or sacrifices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Still, some become <a href="Acolyte">Acolyte</a>, the first true
step on the path of sorcery. Changelings and others who already display
magical affinities can become an acolyte directly. All such students
must be wary – while their master has much to teach them, the master
might also feel threatened by a too-successful acolyte and decide to
feed them to an abomination. <strong>Still, the most powerful rituals
require a great amount of concentrated effort that only acolytes can
provide, so the Sorcerer needs their students, just like the student
needs their master</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>There should be Rules for Ceremonial Magic like in
Symbaroum</strong> -&gt; there are <a
href="Ruins%20of%20Symbaroum%20Ceremonial%20Magic">Ruins of Symbaroum
Ceremonial Magic</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At some point, an acolyte will decide they know enough and wish to
escape their master before they find themselves on the sacrificial
altar. If they are successful then they may give themselves the title
Sorcerer and begin to collect their own followers. If they fail, well
perhaps their blood will be useful for the next ritual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corruption</p>
<p>In the view of the sorcerer the world is dying or already dead, and
Corruption is but one of many symptoms of its irredeemable state. To
fight Corruption is like pretending that death does not exist. Better to
know it, and learn how to understand and use it as much as possible
before everything meets its fated end.</p>
<p>To walk side by side with darkness is a precarious act of balance, to
say the least. Not to give in to darkness is the key, for doing so would
surely mean being completely devoured. Wise Sorcerers accept Corruption,
and exploit it, while still keeping a distance from its cold embrace,
for as long as they possibly can.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>Sorcerers rely on their willpower and force of personality to use
their own reserves of personal power. You use <strong>Charisma</strong>
as your spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells from the
Sorcerer tradition list. <a

<p>Approach Features: ### lvl 1: The Darkened Path - You have
proficiency in your choice of either Deception or Intimidation. -
Sorcerers are used to bearing Corruption as they seek to gain ever
greater power. When you make a Corruption check, you have advantage on
the d20 roll. Note: this is for the initial roll to determine if you
gain a mark of Corruption, not the roll to determine the mark’s nature.
### Lvl 3: The Shadowed Slope - At 3rd level when you cast an unfavored
spell of 4th level or lower, and you have permanent Corruption equal to
the spell level or higher, you gain one less temporary Corruption than
normal, to a minimum of 1 point. example: Lightning Bolt is an unfavored
spell and would normally cause 1d4+3 points of temporary Corruption. A
Sorcerer might gain only 1d4+2 temporary Corruption instead. ### lvl 6:
The Power of Corruption - At 6th level, a Sorcerer can draw on their
Corruption in order to power their spells. You can cast spells up to a
level total equal to or lower than your permanent Corruption without
gaining any Corruption. Each spell must be equal to or lower than your
maximum spell level. When you take an extended rest your total of cast
spells resets to zero. example: If you have 5 permanent Corruption then
you could cast up to five 1st level spells, two 2nd level spells and one
1st level spell, one 3rd level spell and one 2nd level spell, or any
other combination totaling to five spell levels. Then you would need an
extended rest before doing so again. <a

Corruption</a> ### lvl 9: The Call of Darkness - At 9th level, the
Sorcerer can make use of the shadows that lie in the hearts of others.
When you cast a spell that requires a Wisdom saving throw, each affected
creature adds its permanent Corruption to the spell saving throw DC. If
the creature is thoroughly corrupt (see page 38) then this effect does
not apply. ### lvl 13: Revenant Strike - At 13th level when you kill a
living creature on your turn, you may choose to gain a point of
temporary Corruption. If you do so, you can use your bonus action to
cause the slain creature to rise immediately as an undead (use <a
href="Symbaroum%20Monster%20Dragoul%20Zombie">Symbaroum Monster Dragoul
Zombie</a> stats) under your control. It retains its initiative count
but you now control the creature during its turn. This power has no
effect on abominations. After the combat, the creature collapses and
cannot be reanimated. ### lvl 17: Unholy Aura - At 17th level you are
surrounded by a field of negative energy. You can use your bonus action
to cause each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a
Constitution saving throw, inflicting 1d6 necrotic damage for each point
of permanent Corruption that you possess, or half that amount on a
success. You must take a short or longer rest before using this feature
again.</p>
