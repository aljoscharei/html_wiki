Digging</h1>
<p>DIGGING</p>
<p>Digging rate depends on the type of soil, the digger’s Basic Lift
(that is, STxST/5), and the quality of the tools available.</p>
<p>Loose Soil, Sand, etc.: A man can dig 2xBL cubic feet per hour
(cf/hr).</p>
<p>Ordinary Soil: A man can dig BL cf/hr. One man with a pick can break
up 4xBL cf/hr, making it into loose soil, which is easier to remove. The
most efficient way to dig is with one man with a pick, and two shovelers
clearing behind him.</p>
<p>Hard Soil, Clay, etc.: Must be broken up first by a pick, at 2xBL
cf/hr, and then shoveled at 2xBL cf/hr. A lone man with both pick and
shovel can only remove 0.6xBL cf/hr – he loses time switching between
tools.</p>
<p>Hard Rock: Must be broken by a pick at BL cf/hr (or slower, for very
hard rock!), and then shoveled at BL cf/hr.</p>
<p>All of the above assumes iron or steel tools! Halve speeds for wooden
tools (common at TL5 and below). Divide by 4 (or more) for improvised
tools – bare hands, mess kits, etc.</p>
<p>Time Required and Fatigue Cost</p>
<p>To find the time required to dig a given hole, find the volume of the
hole in cubic feet by multiplying height x width x depth (all in feet).
Then divide the number of cubic feet by the digging rate to find the
hours of work required.</p>
<p>Each hour of work costs 1 FP for loose soil, 2 FP for ordinary soil,
3 FP for hard soil, and 4 FP for hard rock.</p>
