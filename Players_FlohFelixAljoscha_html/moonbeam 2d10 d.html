<h1 >Moonbeam</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed
plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius,
40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell
ends, dim light fills the cylinder.<br />
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause
searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes
2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.<br />
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it
also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different
form until it leaves the spell’s light.<br />
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action
to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 2nd.</p>
