<p><em>1st‐level abjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine
silver wire)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window,
or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the
spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature
touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can
designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose
whether the alarm is mental or audible.<br />
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1
mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are
sleeping.<br />
An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within
60 feet.</p>
