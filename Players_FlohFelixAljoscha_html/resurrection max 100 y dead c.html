<h1 >Resurrection</h1>
<p><em>7th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a
century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul
is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit
points.<br />
This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting
the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases,
curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting
the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.<br />
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body
parts.<br />
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to
all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
disappears.<br />
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for
one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you
can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls,
ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
