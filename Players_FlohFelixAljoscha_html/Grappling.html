<h1 >Grappling</h1>
<p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the
Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able
to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces
one of them.</p>
<p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than
you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try
to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll:
a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use).</p>
<p><strong>You succeed automatically if the target is
incapacitated.</strong> <a

5e Conditions Incapacitated</a>.</p>
<p>If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition <a
href="202202102004%205e%20Conditions%20Grappled.html">202202102004 5e
Conditions Grappled</a>. The condition specifies the things that end it,
and you can release the target whenever you like (no action
required).</p>
<p><strong>Escaping a Grapple.</strong> A grappled creature can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics)
check.</p>
<p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature.</strong> When you move, you can
drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved,
unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>
