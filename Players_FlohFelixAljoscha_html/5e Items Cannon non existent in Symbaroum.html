<p>A cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast iron through
the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign without gunpowder, a cannon
might be an arcane device built by clever gnomes or wizardly
engineers.</p>
<p>A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame with wheels. Before
it can be fired, the cannon must be loaded and aimed. It takes one
action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire
it.</p>
