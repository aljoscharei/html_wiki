<h1 >Antipathy/Sympathy</h1>
<p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in
vinegar for the <strong>antipathy</strong> effect or a drop of honey for
the <strong>sympathy</strong> effect)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or
an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of
intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the
specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as
the aura’s effect.<br />
<strong>Antipathy.</strong> The enchantment causes creatures of the kind
you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the
target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet
of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become <a
href="5e%20Conditions%20Frightened.html">5e Conditions Frightened</a>. The
creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60
feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its
movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the
target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and
can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature
becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves
within 60 feet of it.<br />
<strong>Sympathy.</strong> The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60
feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or
comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move
within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t
willingly move away from the target.<br />
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the
affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as
described below.<br />
<strong>Ending the Effect.</strong> If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the
creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature
is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of
repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while
the spell persists.<br />
A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it
for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>
<p>Sympathy: narrative. Dopamine, Drug addiction</p>
<p>uses 1.) Antipathy can make you functionally immune to melee from a
certain kind of creature, e.g. red dragons, at no concentration cost.
Just set it up the day before. This is one of the few saving throw
effects in 5E for which you do not get a re-save every round (unless you
cover your eyes), and even if you make your save, it doesn’t make you
immune to further applications of the effect once you uncover your
eyes.</p>
<p>2.) You can use it to protect areas in exactly the same way during a
set-piece battle. “No hobgoblins over the drawbridge of this castle.”
(Now they have to swarm the walls instead.)</p>
<p>3.) You can use Sympathy to collect things, as a honey-pot trap.
“Everybody stand right here for a Fireball!”</p>
<p>4.) Note that due to the long casting time, Antipathy/Sympathy isn’t
usually an instant-combat spell, it’s more something you do when you
know what’s coming. But! Wish can duplicate Antipathy/Sympathy at the
cost of one action.</p>
<p>Saving does grant immunity for a minute, though, so it’s not
auto-win.</p>
<p>I think the main power of the spell is that it doesn’t need
concentration, lasts for 10 days, and can affect anything that can see
the target. So this is an army-breaker. Need to break a siege? Cast
antipathy on four battle flags, sympathy on four more, keep them covered
until your forces ride out, and use the spells to scatter the enemy army
and funnel them into deathtraps. Against single targets Dominate Monster
is almost always far better.</p>
