This spell creates a billowing cloud of vapor. The cloud fills 1 hex if
the caster is 3rd to 6th level; 2 hexes if 7th to 12th level; and 3
hexes if 13th level or higher. The obscuring cloud is harmless, but
blocks line of sight for all creatures save the caster and those
creatures able to see invisible. The obscuring cloud lasts for the
duration of the battle, or until dispelled.</p>
