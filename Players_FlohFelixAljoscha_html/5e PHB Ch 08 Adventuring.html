<h1 >5e PHB Ch 08 Adventuring</h1>
<p>Delving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping through the back
alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on
the Isle of Dread—these are the things that Dungeons &amp; Dragons
adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore
forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister
plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will
survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.</p>
<p>This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the
mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The
rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of
the activities your character might pursue between adventures.</p>
<p>Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex
relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as
outlined in the book’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/introduction#HowtoPlay">introduction</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The DM describes the environment.</li>
<li>The players describe what they want to do.</li>
<li>The DM narrates the results of their actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking
the characters’ progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness
regions. The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the
adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of
time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM
might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a
map.</p>
