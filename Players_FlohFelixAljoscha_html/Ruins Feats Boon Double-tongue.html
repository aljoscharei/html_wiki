Double-tongue</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
Double-tongue is a language developed by the Thieves Guild in Yndaros –
you say one thing but mean another. This way, sensitive conversations
can be held within earshot of out- siders. If multiple characters know
Double-tongue, they can speak about secrets without risk – provided that
the bystanders do not know the language as well…</p>
