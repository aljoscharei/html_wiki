<h1 >Fear</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong>Self (30-foot cone)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a
hen)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each
creature in a 30-foot <a href="AoE%20Cone.html">AoE Cone</a> must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become <a
href="5e%20Conditions%20Frightened.html">5e Conditions Frightened</a> for
the duration.<br />
While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the <a
href="Dash.html">Dash</a> action and move away from you by the safest
available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.
If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line
of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
<p><a
href="202208070936%20ACKS%20Domains%20at%20War%20Battles#Fear"></a> This
spell affects any one unit within 1 hex of the caster. The unit must
make a saving throw versus Spells; if it fails, it immediately becomes
disordered (if not already), changes its facing towards its own
battlemap edge, and retreats 1 hex. Thereafter, at the start of the
morale phase of each combat round, the unit must retreat a number of
hexes equal to its hustling movement rate towards the friendly map edge.
This continues until the effect is dispelled, the unit leaves the
battlemap, or 30 combat rounds have elapsed. The unit may not be
activated while the spell is in effect.</p>
