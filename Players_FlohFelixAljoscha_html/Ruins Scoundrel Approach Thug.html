<h1 >Ruins Scoundrel Approach
Thug</h1>
<p>The eastern districts of Yndaros are a wilderness as dangerous as
Davokar, and just as rewarding for those who know how to harvest its
fruits. You grew up on streets whose gangs have taught you the art of
making a profit from others’ hard work, right under the noses of the
city watch. Other Thugs rise through the ranks by becoming employed by
barons or counts, free to act as ruffians and enforcers without being
bothered by the Queen’s watchmen.</p>
<p>You have always preferred the direct approach, dispensing violence
directly against your enemies and your employer’s enemies.</p>
