<h1 >Enlarge/Reduce</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow
larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an
object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it
can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no
effect.<br />
If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying
changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns
to normal size at once.<br />
<strong>Enlarge.</strong> The target’s size doubles in all dimensions,
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by
one category– from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough
room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains
the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends,
the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving
throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While
these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4
extra damage.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce.</strong> The target’s size is halved in all
dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category–from Medium to Small, for
example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also
shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the
target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the
damage below 1).</p>
