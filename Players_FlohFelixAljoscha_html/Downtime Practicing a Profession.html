<h1 >Downtime Practicing a
Profession</h1>
<p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest
lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long
you continue to practice your profession.</p>
<p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful
employment, such as a temple or a thievesâ€™ guild, you earn enough to
support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>
<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your
performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to
support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>
