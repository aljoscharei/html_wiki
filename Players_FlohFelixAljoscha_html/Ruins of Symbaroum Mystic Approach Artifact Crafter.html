<h1 >Ruins of
Symbaroum Mystic Approach Artifact Crafter</h1>
<p>The making of artifacts is a highly sought-after art form. I DON’T
LIKE THIS PART. NO ARTIFACTS EXCEPT FROM TROLLS NO NO NO &gt;…that for a
long time was lost to elves and humans (no, only Troll ever knew).
However, among the trolls it has been kept alive, as an almost sacred
practice. Lately, the knowledge has been revived by humans and elves, in
both cases thanks to the trolls of Davokar. The elves received it as a
gift from a former ally, to aid them in these dark days, but how Ordo
Magica managed to get their hands on the lost art is not known. However
it happened, the knowledge has spread so that every chapter soon will
have at least one artifact crafter in its service. &gt;The sudden
reemergence of artifact crafting among mystics has made others question
the source of the knowledge. One belief is that the Ambrian mystics have
stolen it from the trolls – maybe even captured and tortured a troll –
while others suspect that the rulers of the Underworld have traded this
gift in exchange for something very valuable. What version lays closest
to the truth is not easily guessed and the Grand Master refuses to speak
on the topic. NO NO NO</p>

<p>Titles</p>
<p>While the trolls may have specific titles to go with the
everincreasing understanding of their artifact crafters, they have not
shared these with anyone else. In Ordo Magica, artifact crafters share
the same titles as other magic users and those that are self-taught can
give themselves what names please them best.</p>
<p>Corruption</p>
<p>Artifact Crafters use physical objects to mitigate the effects of
Corruption. They still understand Corruption based on their origin and
background – for example, an Ordo Magica Artifact Crafter still views
Corruption as a natural reaction to magic, just one that can be filtered
and reduced by the physical presence of an artifact. Trolls see
Corruption as one more piece of evidence of the darkness now consuming
the world and strive to use discipline alongside their powers to slow
its conquest.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>You use talismans to help manage the cost of Corruption but otherwise
use the normal mystic rules. You can favor cantrips and spells as
normal, and each talisman is bonded to one spell, reducing its
Corruption whenever it is cast. You use Wisdom as your spellcasting
ability modifier. You learn spells from the Troll Singer tradition list

<li>Class Features</li>
<li>Level 1: Talisman Crafter
<ul>
<li>During a long rest you can create a talisman to help you channel the
power of a spell. You begin an adventure with one talisman already
prepared. You cannot have more talismans than your proficiency bonus.
While you possess the talisman, when you cast that spell you gain half
the normal temporary Corruption (rounding up to a minimum of 1). When
you take an extended rest, you can divest yourself of all talismans and
then begin to prepare new ones with the next long rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Level 3: Artifact Expert
<ul>
<li>At 3rd level, you know something about the powerful secrets of the
old rune smiths. At higher levels you are able to create lesser
artifacts.</li>
<li>At 3rd level, you can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check
to determine the spell associated with a talisman. The DC is equal to 10
plus the spell level (DC 10 for cantrips). If you do not know the spell
invested into the talisman you cannot use the talisman. This counts as

<li>At 6th level, your understanding of artifacts is extensive enough
that you are not as affected by their corruptive power. You may reduce
your cost of an artifact’s permanent Corruption by 1, to a minimum of 1
Corruption.</li>
<li>At 9th level, you are able to complete construction of a lesser
artifact (see page 184) when you complete an extended rest (including
the one before an adventure begins).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Talisman Master
<ul>
<li>At 13th level you can use a number of talismans equal to twice your
proficiency bonus. Making a new talisman still requires a long rest to
prepare. Artifact Master</li>
<li>At 17th level you can create one artifact of greater power. This is
the work of a lifetime of learning and effort and so can only be
accomplished once. The Gamemaster has further rules and sample
artifacts, see page 124 in the Ruins of Symbaroum Gamemaster’s
Guide.</li>
