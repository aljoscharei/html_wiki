<p>You summon a creature of living fire to occupy a suit of armor that
you provide. The summoned creature remains within 30 feet of you at all
times and follows your commands. It shares your initiative count and you
can use your bonus action to command it to take an action, such as
attack a target. It can suppress its fiery nature to interact with
objects normally or you can command it to use its action to set
unattended flammable objects alight. If it is destroyed then you cannot
summon the creature again until the next day.</p>
