<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small
twigs, each sharpened to a point)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range
twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes <a
href="5e%20Difficult%20Terrain.html">5e Difficult Terrain</a> for the
duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4
piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.<br />
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any
creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make
a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the
terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>

one of the best battlefield control spells of the lower levels, Spike
Growth is definitely a spell every Druid or Ranger should take as soon
as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Spike Growth isn’t just great for murderhobos, either. It’s also
great for players who want to play peace-loving characters. That’s
because those in the area affected by Spike Growth get to choose how
much damage they’re going to take. If they don’t move, they won’t get
hurt. The spellcaster gets to wash his or her hands of their blood.</p>
<p>2d4 damage is not insubstantial for a Level 2 spell, but the fact
that a creature takes that damage for “every 5 feet it travels” without
getting to roll saving throws to mitigate the damage is kind of
mindblowing. That means if you center the spell on a particular
creature’s position, they’ll take 8d4 damage just to get out of the area
of effect… or stand where they are for ten minutes.</p>
<p>If used to block a narrow choke point, your foes will be forced to
endure 16d4 points of damage to get all the way through it, all while
suffering the additional inconveniences of moving through difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Spike Growth is naturally camouflaged. That
not only makes it good for using as a trap, but also for ruining your
enemies’ plans. If you cast <a href="grease%20w.html">grease w</a> or <a
href="5e%20spells%20web%20w.html">5e spells web w</a> or something to
block off a choke point, your opponents can easily see that and take it
into account when they’re planning their strategy.</p>
<p>If you cast Spike Growth, on the other hand, they might not even know
it until they’ve already put their attack plan into action. Hopefully,
this obstacle will throw a big wrench into it.</p>
<p>But no spell is without its drawbacks, and Spike Growth is no
exception.</p>
<p>The only downside I can really see to this spell is that it requires
concentration. But since the point of Spike Growth is to assert control
of your enemies’ movements on the battlefield, you shouldn’t have much
trouble getting to a safe place where you can easily maintain your
concentration, especially since…</p>
<p>Spike Growth has an insane range of 150 feet!</p>
<p>This spell is nuts. I’d recommend it even if it were a couple of
spell levels higher. Do yourself a favor. Get it and use it often.</p>
