<h1 >Resting</h1>
<p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of
the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat.
They need rest–time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their
minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further
adventure.</p>
<p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day
and a long rest to end the day.</p>
