<p>Constant Training</p>
<p>At 3rd level, you have resolved that the folks you surround yourself
with should benefit from consistent training. Choose a number of pupils
up to your proficiency bonus. As long as you shared their last extended
rest with them, you can use your bonus action to remind them of their
lessons. Each pupil has advantage on any attack rolls they make before
your next turn. You must take a short (or longer) rest before using this
feature again.</p>
