<h1 >Giant Insect</h1>
<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one
scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the
duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a
giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a
giant scorpion.<br />
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on
your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and
resolves their actions and movement.<br />
A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to
0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on
it.<br />
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you
transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a
giant wasp.</p>
