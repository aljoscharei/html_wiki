<p><em>5th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you
appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but
the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.<br />
You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your
speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you
choose.<br />
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were
located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can
switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you
are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own
surroundings.</p>
