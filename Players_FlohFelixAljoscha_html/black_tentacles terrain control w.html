<h1 >Black Tentacles</h1>
<p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant
octopus or a giant squid)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you
can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground
in the area into <a href="5e%20Difficult%20Terrain.html">5e Difficult
Terrain</a>.<br />
When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be <a
href="Restrained.html">Restrained</a> by the tentacles until the spell
ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already
restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.<br />
A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a
Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On
a success, it frees itself.</p>
