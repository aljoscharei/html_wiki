This spell blasts one unit in a hex adjacent to the caster. The damage
from cone of cold is equal to the caster’s level. Damage is doubled
against cavalry units, behemoth cavalry units, or chariot units. If the
unit makes a successful saving throw versus Blast, damage is reduced to
half. A unit may never lose more than 1⁄2 its maximum uhp (rounded up)
from cone of cold.</p>
