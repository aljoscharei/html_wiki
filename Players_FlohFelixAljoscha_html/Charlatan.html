<h1 >Charlatan</h1>
<p>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick,
you can tease out their hearts’ desires after a few minutes of
conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like
they were children’s books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re
perfectly willing to use for your advantage.</p>
<p>You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to
deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound
too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when
you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that
unseemly rash, this ointment — nothing more than a bit of fat with a
sprinkle of silver dust — can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a
bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound
implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal.</p>

False Identity</h4>
<p>You have created a second identity that includes documentation,
established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that
persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers
and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of
document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves
behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see,
what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true
selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or
deep-seated trust issues.</p>
