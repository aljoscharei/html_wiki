<h1 >Strangler</h1>
<p>Once you reach 9th level, if you are <a
href="Grappling.html">Grappling</a> a living creature your size or smaller
and are not carrying anything else, you may use a garrote to strangle
the creature as your action. If you have a creature garroted at the
start of their turn, they begin to choke and will become unconscious
after a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier. A
garroted creature can’t call out for help, but might be able to get an
ally’s attention by other means.</p>
<p>At 13th level, when you have a creature garroted they have
disadvantage on their Escape attempts.</p>
<p>At 17th level, when you grapple a creature you can use Dexterity
(Acrobatics) to initiate the grapple.</p>
