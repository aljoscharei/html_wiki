>Weak
Poison DC 10 1 round plus 1 d6 poison damage plus 3 10 Th d6</h1>
<p>The DC for the poison is dependent on the type of effect selected.
For example, a weak poison at its base either causes the Poisoned
condition for 1 round or 1d6 of poison damage. Choose one effect and
raise the DC for the manufacture of the poison based on the total effect
(according to the number in the name after the “plus”, so weak poison
causing poisoned condition has crafting dc 11, weak poison causing d6
poison damage has dc 13, weak poison causing poisoned condition and d6
damage has crafting dc 14. The save against the poison itself is the
base DC before any modifiers.</p>
