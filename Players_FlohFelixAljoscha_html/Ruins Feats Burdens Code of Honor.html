<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens Code of
Honor</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +2 to Wisdom<br />
You have adopted a very strict code of honor, applicable in all
situations but especially burdensome in combat. The code might specify
that all opponents must be defeated, or that you never stand down from a
fight or that every battle must be an honorable battle one on one. Work
with your GM to determine the specifics.</p>
