<h1 >Call Lightning</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall
with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly
above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the
storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t
accommodate the cloud).<br />
When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt
of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature
within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends,
you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again,
targeting the same point or a different one.<br />
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the
spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a
new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by
1d10.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 3rd.</p>

Call Lightning: This spell can only be used when a storm is overhead.
The spell <a href="control%20weather%20wc.html">control weather wc</a> may
be used to create such a storm! Every 60 combat rounds, the caster may
target one unit within 18 hexes with a bolt of lightning. The targeted
unit suffers 8 points of damage. Damage is doubled against cavalry
units, behemoth cavalry units, or chariot units. If the unit makes a
successful saving throw versus Blast, damage is reduced to half. A unit
may never lose more than 1 / 8 its maximum hit points (rounded up) from
call lightning.</p>
