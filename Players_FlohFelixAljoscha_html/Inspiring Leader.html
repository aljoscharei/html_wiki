<h1 >Inspiring Leader</h1>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Charisma 13 or higher</em></p>
<p>You can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their
resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures
(which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear
you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. A creature
canâ€™t gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has
finished a short or long rest.</p>
