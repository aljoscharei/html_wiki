<h4 >Extreme Cold</h4>
<p>Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-20
°C), a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of <a
href="202202102002%205e%20Conditions%20Exhaustion.html">202202102002 5e
Conditions Exhaustion</a> . Creatures with resistance or immunity to
cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures
wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and
creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.</p>
<h4 >Extreme Heat</h4>
<p>When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C), a
creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain
one level of exhaustion <a
href="202202102002%205e%20Conditions%20Exhaustion.html">202202102002 5e
Conditions Exhaustion</a> . The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases
by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor,
or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving
throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage
automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally
adapted to hot climates.</p>
<h4 >Strong Wind</h4>
<p>A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and
Wisdom (<a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills Perception</a>)
checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open
flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly
impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of
its turn or fall.</p>
<p>A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes
disadvantage on Wisdom (<a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills
Perception</a>) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<h4 >Heavy Precipitation</h4>
<p>Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is <a
href="5e%20lightly%20obscured.html">5e lightly obscured</a> ,and creatures
in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (<a
href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills Perception</a>) checks that
rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes
disadvantage on Wisdom (<a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills
Perception</a>) checks that rely on hearing.</p>
<h3 >High Altitude</h3>
<p>Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is
taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced
amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling
at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how
long that creature can travel.</p>
<p>Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by
spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can’t
become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native
to such environments.</p>
<h3 >Wilderness Hazards</h3>
<p>This section describes a few examples of hazards that adventurers
might encounter in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, require no ability
check to spot. Others, such as defiled ground, are undetectable by
normal senses. The other hazards presented here can be identified with a
successful Intelligence (<a href="5e%20Skills%20Nature.html">5e Skills
Nature</a>) check. Use the guidelines in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game"
title="Running the Game">chapter 8</a> to set an appropriate DC for any
check made to spot or recognize a hazard.</p>
<h4 >Desecrated Ground</h4>
<p>Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of
ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a <a
href="5e%20spells%20detect%20evil%20and%20good%20blight-born%20c.html">5e
spells detect evil and good blight-born c</a> spell cast within range
reveals its presence.</p>
<p>Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving
throws.</p>
<p>A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated
ground when sprinkled on it, and a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hallow">hallow</a> spell purifies
desecrated ground within its area.</p>
<h4 >Frigid Water</h4>
<p>A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes
equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each
additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion <a
href="202202102002%205e%20Conditions%20Exhaustion.html">202202102002 5e
Conditions Exhaustion</a>. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold
damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that
are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.</p>
<h4 >Quicksand</h4>
<p>A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot-square area
and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks
1d4 + 1 feet into the quicksand and becomes restrained <a
href="Restrained.html">Restrained</a> . At the start of each of the
creature’s turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature
isn’t completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its
action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number
of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is
completely submerged in quicksand can’t breathe (see the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#Suffocating">suffocation</a>
rules in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb"
title="Player’s Handbook">Player’s Handbook</a>).</p>
<p>A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a
quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check.
The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into
the quicksand.</p>
<h4 ><a href="Razorvine.html">Razorvine</a></h4>
<h4 >Slippery Ice</h4>
<p>Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto
slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity (<a href="5e%20Skills%20Acrobatics.html">5e Skills
Acrobatics</a> check or fall prone <a href="Prone.html">Prone</a>.</p>
<h4 >Thin Ice</h4>
<p>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per
10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice
exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on
broken ice fall through.</p>
<h4 >Foraging</h4>
<p>Characters can gather food and water as the party travels at a normal
or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom (<a
href="5e%20Skills%20Survival.html">5e Skills Survival</a>) check whenever
you call for it, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and
water in the region. <a href="FORAGER">FORAGER</a></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check.
A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful
check, roll 1d6 + the character’s Wisdom modifier to determine how much
food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in
gallons).</p>
<h4 >Food and Water</h4>
<p>The food and water requirements noted in the Player’s Handbook are
for characters. Horses and other creatures require different quantities
of food and water per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled
if the weather is hot.</p>
