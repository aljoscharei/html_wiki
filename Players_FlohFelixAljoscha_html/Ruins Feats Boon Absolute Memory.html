<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Absolute
Memory</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Intelligence<br />
• Restriction:Dwarves cannot take this feat (they have it as part of
their origin already) You come from a culture or tradition that does not
use writing, but which instead has developed memory techniques to
preserve and transmit vital knowledge. You remember everything seen or
heard, which means that the player may ask the Gamemaster about details
perceived by the player character during their past adventures. The
Gamemaster must answer as thoroughly as possible.</p>
