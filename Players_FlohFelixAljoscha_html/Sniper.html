<p>At 9th level, your ranged weapon attacks have extraordinary
precision. When a creature takes damage from such an at- tack, it must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed becomes zero
until the end of its next turn. The DC is equal to 8 + your Dexterity
modifier + your proficiency bonus or the damage, whichever is
higher.</p>
<p>At 13th level, you score a critical hit with a ranged weapon on a
natural result of 19 or 20.</p>
<p>At 17th level, you double your ability modifier for damage with a
ranged weapon.</p>
