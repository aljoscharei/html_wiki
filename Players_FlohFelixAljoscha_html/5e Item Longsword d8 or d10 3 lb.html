<p>Longsword. The master smiths of the Pansars forge the finest weapons
in Ambria, and the longswords of the Queenâ€™s Guard are an exquisite
testament to that fact, at least when wielded by the right warrior. The
weapon is preferably handled with both hands but can also be used
single-handedly with a shield.</p>
