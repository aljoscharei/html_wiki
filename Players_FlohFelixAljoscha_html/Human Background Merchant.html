<h1 >Human Background Merchant</h1>
<p>As Ambria and its towns grow and reclaim parts of the wilderness, a
new class of folk have arisen. Some travel between settlements bringing
badly needed supplies, tools and knowledge; others work in a single shop
that also serves as their home, preparing food or drink, making tools,
tanning leathers and a dozen other useful endeavors. These are the
merchants of Ambria, and even some of the clanfolks have begun to
welcome the tinkling bells of the merchant’s cart.</p>

<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>Merchants are always looking for the best deal – all of them look for
the best deal for themselves, and the most successful seek the best deal
for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Personality 1. I will trade with anyone. 2. I measure my success in
life in the amount of gold I have. 3. Everybody wants something, and I
want to find out what. 4. I gather gold to help my family or cause. 5. I
love the negotiation as much as the gold. 6. I firmly believe everyone
can win on a deal. 7. I up the stakes so I have something to back down
from. 8. I want to make money and have fun. And making money is fun.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Noble greed. The profit motive drives the world forward.
Nobles, priests and politicians just redistribute wealth created by the
likes of me. 2. Hard work. Idle hands are Corruption’s best friend; keep
busy and Prios will help you. 3. Reputation. I cannot do what I do
unless people trust me. It is paramount. 4. Enlightened self-interest.
Give to them you pass on the way up, so that they can give to you on the
way down. 5. Risk and reward. If you do what others do, you get what
others get. I go where few dare, to get the returns I crave. 6. Early
retirement. I do things I hate for a while so that I then can do what I
love for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Bond 1. My business was handed to me from someone I love, and I will
not see it fail. 2. When I was down someone gave me a loan, and that
saved me. The debt is repaid, but I still feel obliged to help out. 3.
The one I love comes from a fine family and I must succeed in business
to turn our betrothal to marriage. 4. I am indebted to some not very
nice people, and I will repay in full. 5. I have a precious item that I
will never sell. It means too much to me. 6. There is this one charity
that really speaks to me; all I get is a good feeling from giving.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I don’t think I could stop hoarding gold even if I had more
than I could ever spend. It’s a compulsion. 2. I judge people on their
net worth. 3. I think my “friends” and “family” just want my money. 4.
No matter how well I do, the empty and cold place inside me persists. 5.
I don’t get people who value things other than money. 6. I see people
around me in terms of risk and return.</p>
