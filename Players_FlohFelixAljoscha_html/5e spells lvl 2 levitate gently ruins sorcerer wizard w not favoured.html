<h1 >Levitate</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a
piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one
end)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range
rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the
duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds.
An unwilling creature that succeeds on a <strong><a
href="constitution.html">constitution</a></strong> saving throw is
unaffected.</p>
<p>The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object
or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it
to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by
up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target,
you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use
your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s
range.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is
still aloft.</p>

Unlike other save-or-suck spells, Levitate doesn’t allow for saves past
the first save.<br />
Levitate becomes a save or die spell under the following
conditions:<br />
- The target has no or a weak ranged attack - They can’t reach the
ceiling nor the floor 20’ away - They don’t have a fly speed If they
fail their Con save then they float useless mid-air while the party
deals with the rest of enemies. After that we have fun pelting it to
death. Since most encounters often get done by round 5 or 6, that gives
the whole party 5-4 rounds to focus down the target before the spell
ends.<br />
On a Sorcerer twinning it, you dramatically affect the difficulty of an
encounter with few foes in it.<br />
Am I missing something? Do most monsters have a ranged attack past level
7?</p>
<p>Well, it’s concentration, so your wizard is half-nullified while
holding them up in the air. But yeah, other than that there’s no save
beyond the initial one.<br />
That said, don’t forget this bit: &gt; If you are the target, you can
move up or down as part of your move.</p>
<p>So if your move is more than the 20’ the caster can move you, you’re
basically just exchanging an action with the caster as an action tax on
both of you.</p>
<p>https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/140697/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-allowing-a-save-each-turn-against-the-levitate-spe</p>
<p>Consider the spell <em><a
href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Levitate#content">levitate</a></em>
(2nd level), which allows the caster to lift a hostile creature off the
ground and hold it in place. It is easy to make the comparison to spells
like <em><a
href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Person#h-Hold%20Person">hold
person</a></em> (2nd level) and <em><a
href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Monster#h-Hold%20Monster">hold
monster</a></em> (5th level). While the hold spells paralyze the
creature, <em>levitate</em> prevents a creature from moving, and from
making melee attacks.</p>
<p>My DM suggested that the target of <em>levitate</em> be able to
repeat the save every turn, as he felt that <em>levitate</em> was too
strong in comparison to <em>hold person</em> and <em>hold monster</em>.
Is this balanced?</p>
<p>17</p>
<h1 >The <em>hold</em>
spells paralyse, <em>levitate</em> does not</h1>
<p>The main difference I can see between <em>hold person/monster</em>
and <em>levitate</em> is that the former paralyses the target, whereas
the latter only lifts the target upwards.</p>
<p>From <em>hold person</em> (PHB, p.251):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be
<strong>paralyzed</strong> for the duration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <em>hold monster</em> (PHB, p. 251):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be
<strong>paralyzed</strong> for the duration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared with <em>levitate</em> (PHB, p. 255):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One creature of your choice that you can see within range rises
vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration
[Concentration, up to 10 minutes] … An unwilling creature that succeeds
on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A creature affected by <em>levitate</em> can still do many things,
including making ranged attacks and casting their own spells that
require saving throws, whereas someone who is paralysed can do
nothing.</p>
<p>From the Paralyzed condition (PHB, p. 291):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t
move or speak</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Incapacitated condition (PHB, p. 290):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since a paralysed target is a sitting duck, it seems much more fair
to allow them to make a saving throw each round to recover from this,
since they have no other options; someone affected by <em>levitate</em>,
on the other hand, can still do many things, just nothing that requires
melee range or (depending on the room, since you can apparently move
yourself around if you can “climb” along the walls/ceiling)
movement.</p>
<p>So I’m concluding that, because the effects of <em>hold
person/monster</em> are more severe, the target “needs” to make a save
each round more so than someone affected by <em>levitate</em>.</p>
<h2 >Duration</h2>
<p>The other consideration, however, is duration. <em>Hold person</em>
and <em>hold monster</em> both last a minute, whereas <em>levitate</em>
lasts for 10 minutes. Therefore, if someone doesn’t really have a lot of
options (for example, if a melee-focused character who has, say, run out
of javelins) is potentially stuck in the air for 10 minutes, that will
take them out of the fight for longer than someone who is paralysed (if
they have literally <em>no</em> other options to contribute), although
they will at least not be as vulnerable as someone paralysed (i.e. they
can take the Dodge action, as Theik points out, imposing disadvantage on
attack rolls against them, compared to the advantage and auto-crit
imposed by the “paralyzed” condition).</p>
<p>That said, most combat doesn’t last more than a few rounds, so in a
typical combat, this will never be a concern. I’d still lean on the side
of suggesting that allowing a saving throw each round for
<em>levitate</em> would weaken <em>levitate</em>.</p>
<h2
>What
about a Strength check rather than a Constitution save?</h2>
<p>Another idea could be, rather than following the example of <em>hold
person</em>, perhaps borrow from <em>entangle</em> or similar? Being
held in the air against your will, whilst it doesn’t actually restrain
you with regards to the “restrained” condition, does effectively
restrain a melee-focused character. <em>Entangle</em> restrains one or
more creatures as per the “restrained” condition, and provides a
different way to end that condition.</p>
<p>If someone affected by the <em>levitate</em> spell were to be allowed
to use their action to make a Strength check to break free of the
caster’s hold on them, this might be more balanced; they’d still have to
burn an action, rather than getting a “free” saving throw, but it does
still give a melee-focused character suspended in mid-air an option to
do something about it.</p>
<p>For reference, here’s <em>entangle</em> (PHB, p. 268):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a
Strength check against your spell DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 >It will ruin the
innate balance of spells</h1>
<p>Look at the two examples you’ve listed, hold person and levitate.</p>
<p><strong>Levitate:</strong> When used as a hostile spell, if they fail
their initial save, you’re fairly capable of holding them there for ten
minutes. They can still attack, they can still cast spells, they can
still take the dodge action. You can take a melee-only opponent out of
the fight, but that is it.</p>
<p><strong>Hold person:</strong> You inflict paralyze on the opponent,
one of the strongest effects in the game. They auto-fail on certain
saves, they can’t move, speak or act, any attack against them has
advantage against them and any attack from within 5 feet is an automatic
critical hit. This is huge; but the downside is that they get to save at
the end of every round.</p>
<p>You are suggesting giving the only part where Hold Person is weaker
to Levitate as well. If somebody can save against levitate after every
round, why would anybody want to cast levitate instead of hold
person?</p>
