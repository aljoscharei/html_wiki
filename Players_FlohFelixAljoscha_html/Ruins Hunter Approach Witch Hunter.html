Hunter</h1>
<p>You have dedicated your life to fighting blight beasts, may- be as a
consequence of having your own life torn apart by the growing and
infectious darkness: a farm burned to the ground, the grave of your
family, a friend’s horrendous transformation – something that reminds
you of what will happen if the power of the blighted ones is not broken
in time. You will stop at nothing in your fight against evil: you wield
steel, fire and even rituals learned from defeated sorcerers. You
realize that the use of mystical powers may ultimately corrupt you too,
but you turn a blind eye to that and instead fight on with the fervor of
the fanatic. <a href="Deep%20Knowledge.html">Deep Knowledge</a> <a
