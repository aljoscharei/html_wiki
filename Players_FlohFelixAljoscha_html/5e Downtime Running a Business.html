<h1 >5e Downtime Running a Business</h1>
<p>
  Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving
  into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the
  party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they
  hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between
  adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs smoothly.
</p>
<p>
  A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this
  downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the Running a
  Business table to determine what happens.
</p>
<p>
  If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this
  table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt
  incurred in this manner, the character takes a −10 penalty to subsequent rolls
  made on this table.
