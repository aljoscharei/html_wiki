<p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within
range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below
1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is
reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took.
Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum
to return to normal before that time passes.</p>
