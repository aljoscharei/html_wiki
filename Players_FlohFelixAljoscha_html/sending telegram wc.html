<p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Unlimited<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper
wire)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature
with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind,
recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores
of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.<br />
You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of
existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is
a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.</p>
