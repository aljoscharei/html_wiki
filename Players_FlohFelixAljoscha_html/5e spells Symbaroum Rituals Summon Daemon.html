<p>You summon an abomination from the Yonderworld, a dae- mon. The
creature resists your control and you must make a contested Charisma
check to keep it under your control. If you fail and the daemon was not
summoned into an inverted magic circle, the daemon is free to do as it
likes (including at- tacking you or your allies) and is free to roam
until it chooses to return to the Yonderworld (which it can do as an
action) or it is destroyed. If it is trapped in an inverted magic circle
it instead cannot move and returns to the Yonderworld at the end of the
magic circleâ€™s duration. You can talk to the daemon during this time,
but it is under no compulsion to speak or to give you truthful
answers.</p>
<p>If you succeed at the Charisma check then the daemon is under your
control for 24 hours. If requested, it will return to the Yonderworld,
which ends your control of it. It will also carry out your orders,
unless they involve a clear danger to the daemon from the servants of
Prios or another god. It takes its own turn and follows your
commands.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you summon a Servant Daemon. If you choose
to gain a point of permanent Corruption you can instead summon a
Vindictive Daemon, for two points of permanent Corruption you can summon
a Knowledge Daemon or for three points of permanent Corruption you can
summon a Guardian Daemon. The stats for the daemons are included
below.</p>
