<h1 >Snare Fighting</h1>
<p>If using a weapon with the ensnaring prop- erty and you make a
successful attack roll, you can spend a bonus action to forgo do- ing
damage, instead tripping the target and causing it to fall prone. This
only works on creatures your size or smaller with two or less legs, or
similarly shaped targets.</p>
