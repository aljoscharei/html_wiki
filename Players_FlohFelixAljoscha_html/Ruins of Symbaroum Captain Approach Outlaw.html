Captain Approach Outlaw</h1>
<p>Outlaw</p>
<p>Not every captain fights on behalf of their higher-ups. An Outlaw has
broken free from their society and now dis- obeys its laws. Human
Outlaws, either from the barbarians or Ambrians, are often concerned
with those their society has left behind. Others, like elves, dwarves or
trolls may have strained at their limitations and decided on plotting
their own way forward. Outlaws focus on stealth and ranged weaponry to
even the odds and remain free. <a href="Hard%20to%20Find.html">Hard to
