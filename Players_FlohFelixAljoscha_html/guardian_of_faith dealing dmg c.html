<p>A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an
unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The
guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming
sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.<br />
Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the
guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt
a total of 60 damage.</p>
