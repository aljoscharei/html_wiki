<p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see
you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls
against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesnâ€™t rely on
sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with
truesight.</p>
