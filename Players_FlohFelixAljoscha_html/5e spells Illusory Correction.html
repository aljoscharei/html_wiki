<p>There are gaps between reality and our perception of it. By casting
this spell, the mystic takes advantage of these discrepancies. While
this spell is active, when you or another creature within range makes an
<strong>ability check, attack roll, or saving throw</strong> you can use
your <strong>reaction</strong> to make a correction of reality, either
forcing another creature to reroll the d20 or allowing yourself to do
so.</p>
<p>Duration: At the end of your turn if you have used your reaction
since your previous turn, you must make a spellcasting ability check to
keep track of the differences between your personal reality and that
which others perceive. The DC starts at 5 and increases each time by 5.
If you fail the check the spell immediately ends (you cannot use your
reaction to reroll).</p>
