<h1 >Flaming Sphere</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of
brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of
your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that
ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.<br />
As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against
the sphere’s damage, (bad wording. It means: save normally against
caster’s spell save DC and take full or half damage) and the sphere
stops moving this turn.<br />
When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet
tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites
flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 2nd.</p>
<p><strong>As written, the flaming sphere spell deals damage only at the
end of a turn or when used to ram someone. So if you walk into it you
don’t take damage according to Jeremy Crawford.</strong></p>
