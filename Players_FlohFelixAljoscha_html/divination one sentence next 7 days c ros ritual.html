<h1 >Divination</h1>
<p><em>4th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering
appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the
spell consumes)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s
servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event,
or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The
reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.<br />
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that
might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.<br />
If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in
secret.</p>
