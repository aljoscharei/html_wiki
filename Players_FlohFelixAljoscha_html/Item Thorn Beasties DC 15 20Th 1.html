<h1 >Item Thorn Beasties DC 15 20Th
1</h1>
<p>A handful of seeds are thrown to the ground and one turn later 1d4 +
1 thorn beasties appear to serve the user. The thorn beasties are small,
vaguely humanoid creatures made of thorns; they do not speak but squeak
and crack as twigs that are bent and rubbed together. The beasties live
for one hour before drying up to look like thorny witch dolls. The
summoning of the thorn beasties is a clear violation of the natural or-
der, meaning that the one using the seeds suffers 1d6 + 1 temporary
Corruption. <a href="Symbaroum%20Monster%20Thorn%20Beasty">Symbaroum
