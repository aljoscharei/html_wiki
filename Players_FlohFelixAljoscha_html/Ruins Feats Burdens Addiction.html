Addiction</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +2 to an ability score (see below)<br />
You have developed an addiction and must have a dose of your drug each
day, or suffer from withdrawal symptoms. The drug (wine (Constitution),
dream snuff (Wisdom), daft root (Strength) or similar drugs) costs one
shilling per dose. An alchemist can create the drug for themselves or a
friend for half that price.</p>
<p>Each day without the drug, you must also pass a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw. If it fails, you will abandon all other projects and start
hunting for the daily dose. Withdrawal symptoms give a level of
exhaustion each day, with no non- magical way to recover the exhaustion.
After the fifth day, you begin to recover exhaustion as normal, and you
become free of the drug once you have no exhaustion remaining. Once
free, you only need to make the Wisdom saving throw once a month or on a
triggering event (GM’s discretion).</p>
