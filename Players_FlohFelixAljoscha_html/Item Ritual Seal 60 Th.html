<h1 >Item Ritual Seal 60 Th</h1>
<p>The artifact crafter binds a ritual to a seal; when broken, the
effect of the ritual is triggered. The creator of the seal need not know
the ritual, but must be in the company of one who does when it is
created (or have access to a ritual codex explaining the ritual; the
codex is destroyed with this act). He or she who breaks the seal suffers
1d4 temporary Corruption.</p>
