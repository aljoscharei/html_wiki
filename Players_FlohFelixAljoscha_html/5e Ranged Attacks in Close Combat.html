<h1 >5e Ranged Attacks in Close
Combat</h1>
<p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.
When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other
means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet
of a hostile creature who can see you and who isnâ€™t incapacitated.</p>
<p>Stan Shinn: RANGED ATTACKS IN MELEE: When hostile creature is within
5 feet you get disadvantage on attack roll.</p>
