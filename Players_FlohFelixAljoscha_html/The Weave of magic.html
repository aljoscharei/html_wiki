<p>THE WEAVE OF MAGIC</p>
<p>The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All
existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies
untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air
itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will
of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every
manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p>
<p>Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use
of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a
spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the
Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the
goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing
this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away
and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light a candle with
magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the
Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport
hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death
itself.</p>
<p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic
access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks,
sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <strong>arcane magic</strong>.
These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the
workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the
Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane
tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids,
paladins, and rangers are called <strong>divine magic</strong>. These
spellcasters’ access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the
divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.</p>
<p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave
intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters
use divination spells such as <a

detect magic wc ROS ritual</a>  or <a
href="identify%20better%20as%20downtime%20activity%20w.html">identify
better as downtime activity w</a>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such
as <a href="5e%20spells%20dispel%20magic%20wc%20not%20favoured.html">5e
spells dispel magic wc not favoured</a> smooths the Weave. Spells such
as <a href="antimagic%20field%20wc.html">antimagic field wc</a> rearrange
the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, the area
affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn,
magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.</p>
