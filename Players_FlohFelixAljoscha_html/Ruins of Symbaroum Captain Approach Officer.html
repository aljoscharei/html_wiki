Captain Approach Officer</h1>
<p>You grew up in or around the military. You might have been one of the
children in the baggage train that every army accumulates with no sure
knowledge of your parents (or at least your father’s identity), or you
might have waited at your parents’ estate for any news from the front
lines. As soon as you were able, you joined the battle and learned even
more then. But now the war is over and most soldiers, even Officers,
have been dismissed. You might find a sort of similar satisfaction in
watching over a misfit group of adventurers, drilling them into
something resembling a squad of your soldiers. <a
