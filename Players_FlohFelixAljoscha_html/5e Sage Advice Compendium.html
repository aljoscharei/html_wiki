Rulings</h3>
<p>Official rulings on how to interpret rules are made here in the
<em>Sage Advice Compendium</em>. The public statements of the D&amp;D
team, or anyone else at <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Wizards of
the Coast</a>, are not official rulings; they are advice. The tweets of
Jeremy Crawford (<a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford"><span

data-cites="JeremyECrawford">@JeremyECrawford</span></a>), the game’s
principal rules designer, are sometimes a preview of rulings that will
appear here.</p>
<p>A Dungeon Master adjudicates the game and determines whether to use
an official ruling in play. The DM always has the final say on rules
questions.</p>

Role of Rules</h2>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA001"></a>Why
even have a column like Sage Advice when a DM can just make a
ruling?</h4>
<p>Rules are a big part of what makes D&amp;D a game, rather than simply
improvised storytelling.</p>
<p>The game’s rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the
action of a D&amp;D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our
tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools
might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to
guide their use.</p>
<p>The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&amp;D
campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every
contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become
unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what
characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of
D&amp;D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a
foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM’s
role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things
they don’t.</p>
<p>In a typical D&amp;D session, a DM makes numerous rules
decisions—some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also
interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There
are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn’t clear or when
one rule seems to contradict another.</p>
<p>Dealing with those situations is where <em>Sage Advice</em> comes in.
This column doesn’t replace a DM’s adjudication. Just as the rules do,
the column is meant to give DMs, as well as players, tools for tuning
the game according to their tastes. The column should also reveal some
perspectives that help you see parts of the game in a new light and that
aid you in fine-tuning your D&amp;D experience.</p>
<p>When I answer rules questions, I often come at them from one to three
different perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>RAW.</strong> “Rules as written”—that’s what RAW stands for.
When I dwell on the RAW interpretation of a rule, I’m studying what the
text says in context, without regard to the designers’ intent. The text
is forced to stand on its own.</p>
<p>Whenever I consider a rule, I start with this perspective; it’s
important for me to see what you see, not what I wished we’d published
or thought we’d published.</p>
<p><strong>RAI.</strong> Some of you are especially interested in
knowing the intent behind a rule. That’s where RAI comes in: “rules as
intended.” This approach is all about what the designers meant when they
wrote something. In a perfect world, RAW and RAI align perfectly, but
sometimes the words on the page don’t succeed at communicating the
designers’ intent. Or perhaps the words succeed with one group of
players but not with another.</p>
<p>When I write about the RAI interpretation of a rule, I’ll be pulling
back the curtain and letting you know what the D&amp;D team meant when
we wrote a certain rule.</p>
<p><strong>RAF.</strong> Regardless of what’s on the page or what the
designers intended, D&amp;D is meant to be fun, and the DM is the
ringmaster at each game table. The best DMs shape the game on the fly to
bring the most delight to their players. Such DMs aim for RAF, “rules as
fun.” We expect DMs to depart from the rules when running a particular
campaign or when seeking the greatest happiness for a certain group of
players. Sometimes my rules answers will include advice on achieving the
RAF interpretation of a rule for your group.</p>
<p>I recommend a healthy mix of RAW, RAI, and RAF!</p>

<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA002"></a>How
do you calculate a creature’s Armor Class (AC)?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass">Chapter
1</a> of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/">Player’s
Handbook</a> describes how to determine <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass">AC</a>,
yet AC calculations generate questions frequently. That fact isn’t too
surprising, given the number of ways the game gives you to change your
AC! Here are some ways to calculate your base AC:</p>
<p><strong>Unarmored:</strong> 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Armored:</strong> Use the AC entry for the armor you’re
wearing (see <em>PHB</em>, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields">Armor
and Shields</a>”). For example, in leather armor, you calculate your AC
as 11 + your Dexterity modifier, and in chain mail, your AC is simply
16.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmored Defense (Barbarian):</strong> 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmored Defense (Monk):</strong> 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Draconic Resilience (Sorcerer):</strong> 13 + your Dexterity
modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
natural armor bonus. This is a calculation method typically used only by
monsters and NPCs, although it is also relevant to a druid or another
character who assumes a form that has natural armor.</p>
<p>These methods—along with any others that give you a formula for
calculating your AC—are mutually exclusive; you can benefit from only
one at a time. If you have access to more than one, you pick which one
to use. For example, if you’re a sorcerer/monk, you can use either
Unarmored Defense or Draconic Resilience, not both. Similarly, a druid/
barbarian who transforms into a beast form that has natural armor can
use either the beast’s natural armor or Unarmored Defense (you aren’t
considered to be wearing armor when you use natural armor).</p>
<p>What about a shield? A shield increases your AC by 2 while you use
it. For example, if you’re unarmored and use a shield, your AC is 12 +
your Dexterity modifier. Keep in mind that some AC calculations, such as
a monk’s Unarmored Defense, prohibit the use of a shield.</p>
<p>Once you have your base AC, it can be temporarily modified by
situational bonuses and penalties. For instance, having <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover">half
cover</a> gives you a +2 bonus to your AC, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover">three-quarters
cover</a> gives a +5 bonus. Spells sometimes modify AC as well. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield-of-faith">Shield of
faith</a>, for example, grants a target a +2 bonus to AC until the spell
ends.</p>
<p>Magic items can also enhance your AC. Here are a few examples: <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5086-chain-mail-1">+1 chain
mail</a> gives you an AC of 17, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection">ring
of protection</a> gives you a +1 bonus to AC no matter what you’re
wearing, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4594-bracers-of-defense">bracers
of defense</a> grant you a +2 bonus to AC if you’re not wearing armor or
using a shield.</p>

Traits</h2>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA003"></a>Does
the Trance trait allow an elf to finish a long rest in 4 hours?</h4>
<p>If an elf meditates during a long rest (as described in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races#ElfTraits">Trance</a>
trait), the elf finishes the rest after only 4 hours. A meditating elf
otherwise follows all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is
changed.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA004"></a>Do
the lightfoot halfling and wood elf hiding racial traits allow them to
hide while observed?</h4>
<p>The lightfoot halfling and wood elf traits—<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races#Lightfoot">Naturally
Stealthy</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races#WoodElf">Mask
of the Wild</a>—do allow members of those subraces to try to hide in
their special circumstances even when observers are nearby. Normally,
you can’t hide from someone if you’re in full view. A lightfoot
halfling, though, can try to vanish behind a creature that is at least
one size larger, and a wood elf can try to hide simply by being in heavy
rain, mist, falling snow, foliage, or similar natural phenomena. It’s as
if nature itself cloaks a wood elf from prying eyes—even eyes staring
right at the elf! Both subraces are capable of hiding in situations when
most other creatures can’t, but neither subrace’s hiding attempt is
assured of success; a Dexterity (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth">Stealth</a>)
check is required as normal, and an observant foe might later spot a
hidden halfling or elf: “I see you behind that guard, you tricksy
halfling!”</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA005"></a>Can
a dragonborn sorcerer with a draconic bloodline have two different kinds
of Draconic Ancestry?</h4>
<p>A dragonborn sorcerer can choose a different ancestor for the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races#DragonbornTraits">racial
trait</a> and for the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/classes#DraconicBloodline">Dragon
Ancestor</a> feature. Your choice for the racial trait is your actual
ancestor, while the choice for the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>
feature could be your ancestor figuratively—the type of dragon that
bestowed magic upon you or your family or the kind of draconic artifact
or location that filled you with magical energy.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA245"></a>How
long do a shifter’s temporary hit points last?</h4>
<p>Unless a feature says otherwise, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> last until you finish a long rest (PH “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">Temporary
Hit Points</a>”).</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA246"></a>Does
all magical darkness block darkvision?</h4>
<p>Magical darkness blocks <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision">darkvision</a>
only if the rules text for a particular instance of darkness says it
does. For example, the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkness">darkness</a> spell
specifies that it produces a magical darkness that obstructs <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision">darkvision</a>.
That obstruction is a feature of the spell, not of magical darkness in
general.</p>

any of the effects of the roll are applied. Unless a rule tells you
otherwise, a reaction occurs immediately after its trigger.</p>

action is used to activate a Spell-Storing Item?</h4>
<p>Activating a <a

<p>If you use the barbarian’s <a

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA009"></a>Do
the benefits from Bardic Inspiration and the <em>guidance</em> spell
stack? Can they be applied to the same roll?</h4>
<p>Yes, different effects stack if they don’t have the same name. If a
creature makes an ability check while it is under the effect of a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guidance">guidance</a> spell and
also has a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#BardicInspiration-75">Bardic

chooses.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA010"></a>Is
the intent that a bard gets to know the number rolled on an attack roll
or ability check before using Cutting Words, or should they always
guess? If used on a damage roll, does Cutting Words apply to any kind of
damage roll including an auto-hit spell like <em>magic
missile</em>?</h4>
<p>You can wait to use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#CollegeofLore">Cutting
Words</a> after the roll, but you must commit to doing so before you
know for sure whether the total of the roll or check is a success or a
failure. You can use Cutting Words to reduce the damage from any effect
that calls for a damage roll (including <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile">magic missile</a>)
even if the damage roll is not preceded by an attack roll.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA011"></a>Can
a bard replace spells gained through Magical Secrets?</h4>
<p>When you gain a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#Level">level</a>
in the bard class, the class’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#Spellcasting-74">Spellcasting</a>
feature lets you replace one bard spell you know with another bard spell
of an appropriate level. A spell learned through your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#MagicalSecrets-592">Magical
Secrets</a> feature counts as a bard spell for you, so it can be
replaced upon gaining a bard level later. But it must be replaced by a
bard spell, according to the rule in the Spellcasting feature.</p>

<p>A bard can use any <a

scroll</a> that has a bard spell on it—including spells gained from the
<a

<p>No. Only a creature with 0 <a

<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA014"></a>What
happens if a druid wears metal armor?</h4>
<p>The druid explodes.</p>
<p>Well, not actually. Druids have a taboo against wearing metal armor
and wielding a metal shield. The taboo has been part of the class’s
story since the class first appeared in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/6/494/hfm79-eldritch-wizardry.png"><em>Eldritch
Wizardry</em> (1976)</a> and the original <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/6/493/9ukrr-players-handbook.jpg"><em>Player’s
Handbook</em> (1978)</a>. The idea is that druids prefer to be protected
by animal skins, wood, and other natural materials that aren’t the
worked metal that is associated with civilization. Druids don’t lack the
ability to wear metal armor. They choose not to wear it. This choice is
part of their identity as a mystical order. Think of it in these terms:
a vegetarian can eat meat, but chooses not to.</p>
<p>A druid typically wears <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/leather">leather</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/studded-leather">studded
leather</a>, or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/hide">hide</a> armor, and if a
druid comes across <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/scale-mail">scale mail</a>
made of a material other than metal, the druid might wear it. If you
feel strongly about your druid breaking the taboo and donning metal,
talk to your DM. Each <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>
has story elements mixed with its game features; the two types of design
go hand in hand in D&amp;D, and the story parts are stronger in some
classes than in others. Druids and paladins have an especially strong
dose of story in their design. If you want to depart from your class’s
story, your DM has the final say on how far you can go and still be
considered a member of the class. As long as you abide by your
character’s proficiencies, you’re not going to break anything in the
game system, but you might undermine the story and the world being
created in your campaign.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA015"></a>Can
a bound and gagged druid simply use Wild Shape to get out? It’s hard to
capture someone who can turn into a mouse at will.</h4>
<p>Transforming into a different size can be an effective way of
escaping, depending on the nature of the bonds or confinement. All
things considered, someone trying to keep a druid captive might be wise
to stash the prisoner in a room with an opening only large enough for
air to enter.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA016"></a>Does
the druid’s Elemental Wild Shape limit you to the four creatures listed,
or can you turn into any creature with the elemental type?</h4>
<p>The creatures listed in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/druid#CircleoftheMoon">Elemental
Wild Shape</a>—<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16774-air-elemental">air</a>,

and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17051-water-elemental">water</a>
elementals—are specific creatures in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a> , not
creature types or subtypes. Elemental Wild Shape allows you to transform
into one of those creatures.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA017"></a>Can
a Circle of the Moon druid speak the languages it knows while in the
form of an elemental?</h4>
<p>Yes, since the elementals listed in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/druid#CircleoftheMoon">Elemental
Wild Shape</a> can speak.</p>
<p>A literal interpretation (RAW) of Wild Shape could reasonably lead
you to think that transformed druids can speak only languages that
appear in an elemental’s stat block, but the intent (RAI) is that druids
retain their knowledge, including of languages, when they transform and
can speak the languages they know if an adopted form can speak.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA018"></a>If
a druid in elemental form can speak, can the druid cast spells?</h4>
<p>A druid can cast spells in a <a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA020"></a>Does
the fighter’s Action Surge feature let you take an extra bonus action,
in addition to an extra action?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#ActionSurge-193">Action
Surge</a> gives you an extra action, not an extra bonus action. (Recent
printings of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> no
longer include the wording that provoked this question.)</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA021"></a>Can
a fighter have two fighting styles active at once?</h4>
<p>Dueling and Defense, for example. You can benefit from more than one
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#FightingStyle-191">Fighting
Style</a> option at a time, as long as they don’t have conflicting
requirements, as Dueling and Great Weapon Fighting do.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA022"></a>Does
the Archery fighting style work with a melee weapon that you throw?</h4>
<p>No, the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#FightingStyle-191">Archery</a>
feature benefits ranged weapons. A melee weapon, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/dagger">dagger</a> or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/handaxe">handaxe</a>, is still
a melee weapon when you make a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#RangedAttacks">ranged
attack</a> with it.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA023"></a>Is
the Dueling fighting style intended to support a shield?</h4>
<p>Yes. A character with the Dueling option usually pairs a one-handed
weapon with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield">shield</a>, a
spellcasting focus, or a free hand.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA024"></a>If
you use Great Weapon Fighting with a feature like Divine Smite or a
spell like <em>hex</em>, do you get to reroll any 1 or 2 you roll for
the extra damage?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#FightingStyle-191">Great
Weapon Fighting</a> feature—which is shared by fighters and paladins—is
meant to benefit only the damage roll of the weapon used with the
feature. For example, if you use a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/greatsword">greatsword</a>
with the feature, you can reroll any 1 or 2 you roll on the weapon’s
2d6. If you’re a paladin and use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#DivineSmite-264">Divine
Smite</a> with the greatsword, Great Weapon Fighting doesn’t let you
reroll a 1 or 2 that you roll for the damage of Divine Smite.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA025"></a>If
my Battle Master fighter provokes an opportunity attack and it misses,
can I use Riposte?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can use the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#BattleMaster">Riposte</a>
maneuver in response to an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a> that misses you, assuming your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
is available.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA026"></a>Does
the “when” in the Eldritch Knight’s War Magic feature mean the bonus
attack comes after you cast the cantrip, or can it come before?</h4>
<p>The bonus action comes after the cantrip, since using your action to
cast a cantrip is what gives you the ability to make the weapon attack
as a bonus action. That said, a DM would break nothing in the system by
allowing an Eldritch Knight to reverse the order of the cantrip and the
weapon attack.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA027"></a>If
my Eldritch Knight casts <em>true strike</em> and has the War Magic
feature, is the attack granted by War Magic made with advantage because
of <em>true strike</em>?</h4>
<p>No. The attack from <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#WarMagic-222">War
Magic</a> is made normally, and you get the benefit of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-strike">true strike</a> on
your next turn if the spell hasn’t ended.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA252"></a>Can
the Disarming Attack maneuver disarm a creature of a shield it has
donned?</h4>
<p>No. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#Maneuvers-214">Disarming
Attack</a> forces a creature to drop an object it is holding. Donned
shields aren’t merely held.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#Monk"></a>Monk</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA028"></a>If
a monk uses a staff or another versatile weapon two-handed, does it
still count as a monk weapon?</h4>
<p>Yes. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#MartialArts-227">monk
weapon</a> must lack the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">two-handed</a>
property, but nothing prevents a monk from wielding such a weapon with
two hands. Fundamentally, a monk weapon counts as such no matter how a
monk uses it.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA029"></a>The
dart is not classified as a monk weapon, yet a monk gets 10 darts as
starting equipment. Why is that?</h4>
<p>Starting equipment often lends versatility to a character. In this
case, a monk’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/dart">darts</a> provide a
ranged attack option, not a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#MartialArts-227">Martial
Arts</a> option.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA030"></a>Does
the Martial Arts feature turn monk weapons and unarmed strikes into
finesse weapons?</h4>
<p>No. The feature grants a benefit that is similar to the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">finesse</a>
property, but the feature doesn’t confer that property.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA031"></a>When
a monk using Deflect Missiles catches and throws a projectile, what is
the damage of the attack?</h4>
<p>A missile counts as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#MartialArts-227">monk
weapon</a> if it is thrown using <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#DeflectMissiles-231">Deflect
Missiles</a>; it deals its damage or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#MartialArts-227">Martial
Arts</a> damage (the monk’s choice).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA032"></a>Can
a monk use Stunning Strike with an unarmed strike, even though unarmed
strikes aren’t weapons?</h4>
<p>Yes. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#StunningStrike-235">Stunning
Strike</a> works with melee weapon attacks, and an unarmed strike is a
special type of melee weapon attack.</p>
<p>The game often makes exceptions to general rules, and this is an
important exception: that unarmed strikes count as melee weapon attacks
despite not being weapons.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA033"></a>When
a monk uses Empty Body, does the invisibility remain in effect after the
monk attacks?</h4>
<p>Yes. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible">invisibility</a>
of the monk’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#EmptyBody-243">Empty
Body</a> isn’t ended by the monk attacking.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA034"></a>Does
a monk’s Purity of Body feature grant immunity to poison damage, the
poisoned condition, or both?</h4>
<p>That feature grants immunity to both. As a result, a monk with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#PurityofBody-239">Purity of
Body</a> can, for example, inhale a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17073-young-green-dragon">green
dragon’s</a> poison breath unharmed. Similarly, the monk is unaffected
by <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ray-of-sickness">ray of
sickness</a>, which both deals <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#DamageTypes">poison
damage</a> and imposes the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned">poisoned</a>
condition.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA035"></a>Can
the monk’s Open Hand Technique push a Large or larger creature or knock
it prone?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#OpenHandTechnique-256">Open
Hand Technique</a> intentionally ignores creature size. A monk’s ki
fuels many extraordinary effects! If a feature is limited by creature
size, the feature tells you so.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA036"></a>Does
a monk need to spend any ki points to cast the <em>minor illusion</em>
cantrip granted by the Shadow Arts feature?</h4>
<p>No. The ki point cost in the feature applies only to the other spells
in it.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA037"></a>For
a Way of Shadow monk, can their <em>silence</em> be dispelled?</h4>
<p>A spell is a spell, no matter its source. When you cast a spell
through a feature, the spell is subject to the normal <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting">spellcasting</a>
rules, unless the feature says otherwise.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA038"></a>Can
a monk of the Way of the Four Elements replace Elemental Attunement with
another elemental discipline?</h4>
<p>Yes. Even though you know Elemental Attunement automatically, without
having to choose it, you can exchange it for a different discipline at
6th, 11th, or 17th <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#Level">level</a>.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#Paladin"></a>Paladin</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA039"></a>Would
a Paladin’s Divine Sense register a tiefling due to their infernal
heritage?</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/tiefling">tiefling</a> is
a humanoid, not a fiend, and therefore escapes the notice of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#DivineSense-260">Divine
Sense</a>. The feature detects creatures that have the celestial, fiend,
or undead creature type.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA040"></a>Can
my paladin use a smite spell along with Divine Smite? As in, I cast
<em>wrathful smite</em>, hit, then use Divine Smite on the same
attack?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#DivineSmite-264">Divine
Smite</a> on the same weapon attack that benefits from a smite spell,
such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wrathful-smite">wrathful
smite</a>—as long as the attack you make after casting the smite spell
is a melee weapon attack. Divine Smite doesn’t work with any other kind
of attack.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA253"></a>Can
a paladin use Divine Smite when they hit using an unarmed strike?</h4>
<p>No. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#DivineSmite-264">Divine
Smite</a> isn’t intended to work with unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Divine Smite does work with a melee weapon attack, and an unarmed
strike can be used to make such an attack. But the text of Divine Smite
also refers to the “weapon’s damage,” and an unarmed strike isn’t a
weapon.</p>
<p>If a DM decides to override this rule, no imbalance is created. Tying
Divine Smite to weapons was a thematic choice on our part—paladins being
traditionally associated with weapons. It was not a game balance
choice.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#Ranger"></a>Ranger</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA041"></a>There
is no component pouch option in the ranger’s starting equipment. Does
the class not need one, nor a focus for spells?</h4>
<p>Like other spellcasters, the ranger follows the rule on <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Components">components</a>
in chapter 10 of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> . A
ranger typically uses a component pouch for the material components of
spells, but doesn’t start with one because rangers don’t have spells at
1st <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#Level">level</a>.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA042"></a>Can
a ranger move between the attack rolls of the Whirlwind Attack
feature?</h4>
<p>No. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#Multiattack-340">Whirlwind
Attack</a> is unusual, in that it’s a single attack with multiple attack
rolls. In most other instances, an attack has one attack roll. The rule
on moving between attacks (<em>PHB</em> , “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#MovingBetweenAttacks">Moving
Between Attacks</a>”) lets you move between weapon attacks, not between
the attack rolls of an exceptional feature like Whirlwind Attack.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA254"></a>Does
a Monster Slayer ranger’s Supernatural Defense feature apply if a
creature damages the ranger, thus causing the ranger to make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell?</h4>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#Rogue"></a>Rogue</h3>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA043"></a>Can
a rogue use Sneak Attack more than once per round?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#SneakAttack-343">Sneak
Attack</a> description specifies that you can use the feature once per
turn, but it’s not limited to your turn. The feature also doesn’t limit
the number of times you can use it in a round.</p>
<p>You sometimes get a chance to use Sneak Attack on someone else’s
turn. The most common way for this to happen is when a foe provokes an
opportunity attack from you. If the requirements for Sneak Attack are
met, your opportunity attack can benefit from that feature. Similarly, a
fighter could use Commander’s Strike to grant you an attack on the
fighter’s turn, and if the attack qualifies, it can use Sneak Attack.
Both of those options rely on the use of your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>,
so you could do only one of them in a round.</p>
<p>Because you get only one <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
per round, you’re unlikely to use Sneak Attack more than twice in a
round: once with your action and once with your reaction.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA044"></a>For
Sneak Attack, what if another enemy of your target was 10 feet away with
a polearm (which has a reach of 10 feet), instead of 5 feet away? Would
you still be able to use Sneak Attack?</h4>
<p>The 5-foot limitation in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#SneakAttack-343">Sneak
Attack</a> is unaffected by the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">reach</a>
of a weapon. That other enemy of the target is creating a close-up
distraction, regardless of the weapon in hand.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA045"></a>Does
Uncanny Dodge work automatically against every attack a rogue or ranger
gets hit by? Spell attacks too?</h4>
<p>A use of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#UncannyDodge-347">Uncanny
Dodge</a> works against only one attack, since it expends your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>,
and only if you can see the attacker. It works against attacks of all
sorts, including spell attacks, but it is no help against a spell or
other effect, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a>, that
delivers its damage after a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throw</a> rather than after an attack roll.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA046"></a>Can
a rogue use Evasion if they are surprised?</h4>
<p>The rule states that if you are <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>,
you can’t move or take an action. A surprised rogue can use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#Evasion-348">Evasion</a>,
since that feature doesn’t require the rogue to take an action or
move.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA047"></a>Can
the rogue’s Reliable Talent feature be used in conjunction with
Remarkable Athlete or Jack of All Trades?</h4>
<p>No. Each of these features has a precondition for its use; <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#ReliableTalent-349">Reliable
Talent</a> activates when you make an ability check that uses your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a>, whereas the other two features activate when you make an
ability check that doesn’t use your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a>. In other words, a check that qualifies for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#ReliableTalent-349">Reliable
Talent</a> doesn’t qualify for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#RemarkableAthlete-216">Remarkable
Athlete</a> or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#JackofAllTrades-79">Jack of
All Trades</a>. And Remarkable Athlete and Jack of All Trades don’t work
with each other, since you can add your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a>, or any portion thereof, only once to a roll.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA048"></a>Can
a thief use the Fast Hands feature to activate a magic item?</h4>
<p>No. One of the benefits of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#FastHands-364">Fast
Hands</a> is being able to take the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject">Use
an Object</a> action as a bonus action, but using a magic item doesn’t
fall under Use an Object, as explained in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>
(see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#ActivatinganItem">Activating
an Item</a>”). In contrast, using a nonmagical item, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/healers-kit">healer’s kit</a>,
is in the domain of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject">Use

round?</h4>
<p>A <a

creature stops being surprised at the end of its first turn in
combat.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA255"></a>Does
the Thief’s Use Magic Device feature allow them to use spell
scrolls?</h4>
<p>Yes. The intent is that a Thief can use spell scrolls with <a

Magic Device</a>.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA256"></a>Can
a Thief use Fast Hands to use or apply poisons?</h4>
<p>Yes. Administering poison uses the <a

an Object</a> action.</p>
<h3 ><a

<h4
>If
a sorcerer casts a spell with only verbal or somatic components using

href="5e%20spells%20counterspell%20interrupt%20w%20not%20favoured.html">5e
spells counterspell interrupt w not favoured</a></h4>
<p>If a spell that’s altered by Subtle Spell <a
href="sorcerer#Subtle%20Spell"></a> has no material component, then it’s
impossible for anyone to perceive the spell being cast. So, since you
can’t see the casting, conterspell is of no use.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA051"></a>Metamagic
rules state you can’t use multiple Metamagic options on a single spell.
Can you use one option multiple times?</h4>
<p>A sorcerer can use one <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer#Metamagic-372">Metamagic</a>
option once in the casting of a spell, not the same option more than
once. For instance, a sorcerer can’t quadruple the duration of a spell
by spending 2 sorcery points on Extended Spell.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA052"></a>Elemental
Affinity improves one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls? So
with <em>scorching ray</em>, I don’t add my Charisma modifier to each
ray that hits?</h4>
<p>That’s correct. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer#ElementalAffinity-378">Elemental
Affinity</a> benefits one damage roll per casting of a spell, even if
the spell allows more than one roll. So, for example, the feature
improves one of the rays of a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray">scorching ray</a>
spell or one of the beams of an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast">eldritch

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA053"></a>Can
Empowered Spell affect all the rays of a <em>scorching ray</em> spell,
or just one?</h4>
<p>A sorcerer’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer#Metamagic-372">Empowered
Spell</a> could affect more than one ray of a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray">scorching ray</a>,
abiding by the feature’s die limit. For instance, if you create three
rays with the spell and you have a +3 Charisma modifier, you could
reroll one of the damage dice for each ray, or two of the damage dice
for one ray and one of the damage dice for another one.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA054"></a>Does
Quickened Spell allow a sorcerer to cast two spells a round of 1st level
or higher?</h4>
<p>No, the sorcerer must follow the rule for casting a spell as a bonus
action and casting another spell on the same turn; the other spell must
be a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA055"></a>Can
my sorcerer use Twinned Spell on a spell duplicated by the casting of a

cost?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can. It costs the number of sorcery points appropriate for
the level of the spell you’re duplicating.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA056"></a>Does
a sorcerer’s Wild Magic Surge effect replace the effect of the spell
that triggered it, or do both effects happen?</h4>
<p>The spell and the <a

Magic Surge</a> effect both happen. As clarified in the errata for the

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA244"></a>Can
my sorcerer use Twinned Spell to affect a particular spell?</h4>
<p>You can use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer#Metamagic-372">Twinned
Spell</a> on a spell that …</p>
<ul>
<li>targets only one creature</li>
<li>doesn’t have a range of self</li>
<li>is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s
current level</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know this rule yet are still unsure whether a particular spell
qualifies for Twinned Spell, consult with your DM, who has the final
say. If the two of you are curious about our design intent, here is the
list of things that disqualify a spell for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spell has a range of self.</li>
<li>The spell can target an object.</li>
<li>The spell allows you to choose more than one creature to be affected
by it, particularly at the level you’re casting the spell. Some spells
increase their number of potential targets when you cast them at a
higher level.</li>
<li>The spell can force more than one creature to make a saving throw
before the spell’s duration expires.</li>
<li>The spell lets you make a roll of any kind that can affect more than
one creature before the spell’s duration expires</li>
</ul>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA057"></a>Do
warlock spells granted by the Expanded Spell List feature count against
the number of spells known?</h4>
<p>The spells granted by that feature aren’t automatically known by a
warlock. Those spells are added to the warlock spell list for the
character, who can choose them when learning a new warlock spell of the
appropriate level. Once learned, such a spell does count against the
number of spells the warlock knows.</p>

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA058"></a>Does
the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation work on magical runes?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#EldritchInvocations-388">Eyes
of the Rune Keeper</a> lets you read any form of writing, including the
linguistic meaning of a rune, if any.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA059"></a>If
a warlock uses Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, does that
weapon have to be a melee weapon, and can the warlock change the
weapon’s form?</h4>
<p>The warlock’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#PactBoon-389">Pact of
the Blade</a> feature lets you create a melee weapon out of nothing.
Whenever you do so, you determine the weapon’s form, choosing from the
melee weapon options in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#Weapons">Weapons
table</a> in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>. For
example, you can create a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/greataxe">greataxe</a>, and
then use the feature again to create a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/javelin">javelin</a>, which
causes the greataxe to disappear.</p>
<p>You can also use Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon,
turning it into your pact weapon. This magic weapon doesn’t have to be a
melee weapon, so you could use the feature on a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5244-longbow-1">+1
longbow</a>, for instance. Once the bond is formed, the magic weapon
appears whenever you call your pact weapon to you, and you can’t change
the magic weapon’s form when it appears. For example, if you bond with a
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4895-flame-tongue-longsword">flame
tongue (longsword)</a> and send the weapon to an extradimensional space,
the weapon comes back as a longsword when you summon it. You don’t get
to turn it into a club. Similarly, if you bond with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4613-dagger-of-venom">dagger
of venom</a>, you can’t summon it as a maul; it’s always a dagger.</p>
<p>The feature allows the conjuring forth of a melee weapon, yet we
allow more versatility when it comes to magic weapons. We didn’t want a
narrow focus in this feature to make a warlock unhappy when a variety of
magic weapons appear in a campaign. Does this versatility extend outside
the melee theme of the feature? It sure does, but we’re willing to
occasionally bend a design concept if doing so is likely to increase a
player’s happiness.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA060"></a>If
you’re a Pact of the Blade warlock, can someone else wield your pact
weapon?</h4>
<p>Yes. Someone other than the warlock can use a pact weapon before the
weapon disappears.</p>

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA061"></a>Does
the warlock’s Awakened Mind feature allow two-way telepathic
communication?</h4>
<p>The feature is intended to provide one-way communication. The warlock
can use the feature to speak telepathically to a creature, but the
feature doesn’t give that creature the ability to telepathically reply.
In contrast, the telepathy ability that some monsters have (<em>MM</em>
, “<a

does make two-way communication possible.</p>

<p>An <a

<p>No. In the case of a multipart object, the intent is that you must

Expert</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA082"></a>Is
it intentional that the second benefit of Crossbow Expert helps ranged
spell attacks?</h4>
<p>Yes, it’s intentional. When you make a ranged attack roll within 5
feet of an enemy, you normally suffer <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>.
The second benefit of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/crossbow-expert">Crossbow
Expert</a> prevents you from suffering that disadvantage, whether or not
the ranged attack is with a crossbow.</p>
<p>When designing a feat with a narrow use, we consider adding at least
one element that can benefit a character more broadly—a bit of mastery
that your character brings from one situation to another. The second
benefit of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/crossbow-expert">Crossbow
Expert</a> is such an element, as is the first benefit of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/great-weapon-master">Great Weapon
Master</a>. That element in Crossbow Expert shows that some of the
character’s expertise with one type of thing—crossbows, in this
case—transfers to other things.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA083"></a>Do
the first and third benefits of Crossbow Expert turn a hand crossbow
into a semiautomatic weapon?</h4>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The first benefit of the feat lets you ignore the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">loading</a>
property of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-hand">hand
crossbow</a> if you’re proficient with that weapon. The upshot is that
you can fire it more than once if you have a feature like Extra Attack.
You’re still limited, however, by the fact that the weapon has the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">ammunition</a>
property. The latter property requires you to have a bolt to fire from
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-hand">hand
crossbow</a>, and the hand crossbow isn’t going to load itself (unless
it’s magical or a gnomish invention). You need to load each bolt into
the weapon, and doing so requires a hand.</p>
<p>To dig deeper into this point, take a look at the following sentence
in the definition of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">ammunition</a>
property: “Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other
container is part of the attack.” The sentence tells us two important
things. First, you’re assumed to be drawing—that is, extracting with
your hand—the ammunition from a container. Second, the act of drawing
the ammunition is included in the attack and therefore doesn’t require
its own action and doesn’t use up your free interaction with an object
on your turn.</p>
<p>What does that all mean for a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-hand">hand
crossbow</a>? It means <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/crossbow-expert">Crossbow
Expert</a> makes it possible to fire a hand crossbow more than once with
a feature like Extra Attack, provided that you have enough ammunition
and you have a hand free to load it for each shot.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA084"></a>Does
Crossbow Expert let you fire a hand crossbow and then fire it again as a
bonus action?</h4>
<p>It does! Take a look at the feat’s third benefit. It says you can
attack with a hand crossbow as a bonus action when you use the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action to attack with a one-handed weapon. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-hand">hand
crossbow</a> is a one-handed weapon, so it can, indeed, be used for both
attacks, assuming you have a hand free to load the hand crossbow between
the two attacks.</p>

the Great Weapon Master feat, do you have to take the bonus action
immediately, or could you move and then use it on the same turn?</h4>
<p>You take the bonus action on your turn, anytime after you hit with

taking the bonus action (if you have movement remaining).</p>

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA088"></a>How
does the Lucky feat interact with advantage and disadvantage?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/lucky">Lucky</a> feat
represents extraordinary luck that can help you when you need it most.
It lets you spend a luck point; roll an extra d20 for an attack roll,
ability check, or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throw</a>; and then choose which d20 to use. This is true no matter how
many d20s are in the mix. For example, if you have <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
on your attack roll, you could spend a luck point, roll a third d20, and
then decide which of the three dice to use. You still have <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>,
since the feat doesn’t say it negates it, but you get to pick the die.
The upshot of this fact is that a rogue, for instance, who has <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
on an attack roll couldn’t use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#SneakAttack-343">Sneak
Attack</a> even if the rogue uses the Lucky feat to pick the die.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/lucky">Lucky</a> feat is
a great example of an exception to a general rule. The general rule in
this case is the one that tells us how <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
work. The specific rule is the Lucky feat, and we know that a specific
rule trumps a general rule if they conflict with each other.</p>
<p>If a DM wants <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
to play their normal roles even when the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/lucky">Lucky</a> feat is used,
here’s a way to do so: roll two d20s for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>/<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>,
roll a third d20 for Lucky, eliminate one of the three dice, and then
use the higher (for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>)
or lower (for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>)
of the two dice that remain.</p>

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA089"></a>If
you’re a spellcaster, can you pick your own class when you gain the
Magic Initiate feat?</h4>
<p>Yes, the feat doesn’t say you can’t. For example, if you’re a wizard
and gain the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/magic-initiate">Magic Initiate</a>
feat, you can choose wizard and thereby learn two more wizard cantrips
and another 1st-level wizard spell.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA090"></a>If
you have spell slots, can you use them to cast the 1st-level spell you
learn with the Magic Initiate feat?</h4>
<p>Yes, but only if the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>
you pick for the feat is one of your classes. For example, if you pick
sorcerer and you are a sorcerer, the Spellcasting feature for that class
tells you that you can use your spell slots to cast the sorcerer spells
you know, so you can use your spell slots to cast the 1st-level sorcerer
spell you learn from <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/magic-initiate">Magic
Initiate</a>. Similarly, if you are a wizard and pick that class for the
feat, you learn a 1st-level wizard spell, which you could add to your
spellbook and subsequently prepare.</p>
<p>In short, you must follow your character’s normal spellcasting rules,
which determine whether you can expend spell slots on the 1st-level
spell you learn from Magic Initiate.</p>

Master</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA091"></a>Can
I add my Strength modifier to the damage of the bonus attack that
Polearm Master gives me?</h4>
<p>Yes. If you have the feat and use the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action to attack with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/glaive">glaive</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/halberd">halberd</a>, or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>,
you can also strike with the weapon’s opposite end as a bonus action.
For that bonus attack, you add your ability modifier to the attack roll,
as you do whenever you attack with that weapon, and if you hit, you add
the same ability modifier to the damage roll, which is normal for weapon
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#DamageRolls">damage
rolls</a>.</p>
<p>A specific rule, such as the rule for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting">two-weapon
fighting</a>, might break the general rule by telling you not to add
your ability modifier to the damage. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/polearm-master">Polearm Master</a>
doesn’t have such a rule.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA092"></a>Does
Polearm Master let me make an opportunity attack against a target that
is being forced to approach me?</h4>
<p>A creature doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack if it is moved
without the use of its movement, its action, or its <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>.
For example, the effect of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antipathy-sympathy">antipathy/sympathy</a>
spell requires the target to use its movement, meaning that it would
provoke opportunity attacks when it does so.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dissonant-whispers">dissonant
whispers</a> requires the target to move using its <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
(if available), so that activity also provokes opportunity attacks. In
contrast, a creature that’s pushed by a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a>
spell does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

Attacker</h3>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA093"></a>Does
the Savage Attacker feat work with unarmed strikes?</h4>
<p>No. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/savage-attacker">Savage
Attacker</a> relies on a weapon’s damage dice, and an unarmed strike
isn’t a weapon (a point that was clarified in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>
errata).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA094"></a>Does
the benefit of the Savage Attacker feat apply to additional effects like
the rogue’s Sneak Attack or the paladin’s Divine Smite?</h4>
<p>No. The benefit of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/savage-attacker">Savage
Attacker</a> applies only to rolls of the weapon’s damage dice, not to
any extra damage that a feature or other ability might grant.</p>
<h3 ><a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA095"></a>Does
the attack granted by the third benefit of the Sentinel feat take place
before or after the triggering attack?</h4>
<p>The bonus attack takes place after the triggering attack. Here’s why:
the feat doesn’t specify the bonus attack’s timing, and when a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
has no timing specified, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes
(<em>DMG</em>, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#AdjudicatingReactionTiming">Adjudicating
Reaction Timing</a>”). In contrast, an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a> specifically takes place before its trigger finishes—that is,
right before the target creature leaves your reach.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA096"></a>How
does the Sentinel feat work against an enemy that has Fancy Footwork or
the Mobile feat?</h4>
<p>Does the character with the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/sentinel">Sentinel</a> feat still
get the opportunity attack? The second benefit of the Sentinel feat is
intended to counteract the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage">Disengage</a>
action only. An enemy with the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#FancyFootwork-507">Fancy
Footwork</a> feature (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s
Guide</a>) or one that has the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/mobile">Mobile</a> feat can avoid
provoking opportunity attacks from someone who has the Sentinel feat, as
long as that enemy doesn’t take the <a

action.</p>

the Tough feat have an effect for a druid while in beast form?</h4>
<p>The intent is no. The <a

druid’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit

Checks</h2>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA099"></a>Are
attack rolls and saving throws basically specialized ability
checks?</h4>
<p>They aren’t. It’s easy to mistake the three rolls as three faces of
the same thing, because they each involve rolling a d20, adding any
modifiers, and comparing the total to a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AbilityChecks">Difficulty
Class</a>, and they’re all subject to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>.
In short, they share the same procedure for determining success or
failure.</p>
<p>Despite this common procedure, the three rolls are separate from each
other. If something in the game, like the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guidance">guidance</a> spell,
affects one of them, the other two aren’t affected unless the rules
specifically say so. The next few questions touch on this point
again.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA100"></a>Can
you get a critical hit on an ability check? For example, on a grapple
attempt, does a critical win, or the highest number?</h4>
<p>Ability checks don’t score <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CriticalHits">critical
hits</a>. Attack rolls do.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA101"></a>Is
a 1 on an ability check an automatic failure?</h4>
<p>Rolling a 1 on an ability check or a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throw</a> is not an automatic failure. A 1 is an automatic miss for an
attack roll.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA102"></a>If
you cast the <em>hex</em> spell and choose Strength as the affected
ability, does the target also have disadvantage on attack rolls and
saving throws that use Strength?</h4>
<p>No, the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex">hex</a>
spell’s description says it affects ability checks that use the chosen
ability. The description says nothing about affecting attack rolls or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throws</a>. This means, for example, that if you choose Constitution,
the spell’s target doesn’t suffer <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
when trying to maintain <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration">concentration</a>
on a spell, since concentration requires a Constitution saving throw,
not a Constitution check.</p>
<p>Curious about the spell’s intent? The spell is meant to be a classic
jinx—the sort seen in folklore—that is useful in and out of combat. In
combat, the spell provides some extra <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#DamageTypes">necrotic
damage</a>. Outside combat, you could foil a cunning diplomat, for
example, by casting the spell and imposing <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
on his or her Charisma checks.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA103"></a>Does
the bard’s Jack of All Trades feature apply to attack rolls and saving
throws that don’t use the bard’s proficiency bonus?</h4>
<p>No. The feature benefits only ability checks. Don’t forget that
initiative rolls are Dexterity checks, so <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#JackofAllTrades-79">Jack of
All Trades</a> can benefit a bard’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Initiative">initiative</a>,
assuming the bard isn’t already adding his or her <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a> to it.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA104"></a>When
you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple or shove someone, are
you making an attack roll?</h4>
<p>No. That check is an ability check, so game effects tied to attack
rolls don’t apply to it. Going back to an earlier question, the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex">hex</a> spell could be used
to diminish a grappler’s effectiveness. And if the grappler’s target is
under the effect of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge">Dodge</a>
action, that action doesn’t inhibit the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Grappling">grapple</a>,
since Dodge doesn’t affect ability checks.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA105"></a>Is
there a hard limit on how many short rests characters can take in a day,
or is this purely up to the DM to decide?</h4>
<p>The only hard limit on the number of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#ShortRest">short
rests</a> you can take is the number of hours in a day. In practice,
you’re also limited by time pressures in the story and foes

extradimensional spaces, such as a demiplane or the space created by

existence?</h4>
<p>An extradimensional space (aka an extraplanar space) is outside other
planes. Therefore, if you’re on the Material Plane and your foe is in an
extradimensional space, the two of you aren’t on the same plane of
existence.</p>

to its space?</h4>
<p>No. If you can’t see something, it’s not within your line of sight.
Speaking of “line of sight,” the game uses the English meaning of the
term, which has no special meaning in the rules.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA261"></a>Does

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA111"></a>Does
surprise happen outside the initiative order as a special surprise
round?</h4>
<p>No, here’s how <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprise</a>
works.</p>
<p>The first step of any combat is this: the DM determines whether
anyone in the combat is surprised (reread “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#COMBATSTEPBYSTEP">Combat
Step by Step</a>” in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>).
This determination happens only once during a fight and only at the
beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can’t be <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>
again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal benefits from
being unseen (see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#UnseenAttackersandTargets">Unseen
Attackers and Targets</a>” in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>).</p>
<p>To be surprised, you must be caught off guard, usually because you
failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy
with a special ability, such as the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16869-gelatinous-cube">gelatinous
cube’s</a> Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising.
You can be surprised even if your companions aren’t, and you aren’t
surprised if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares.</p>
<p>If anyone is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>,
no actions are taken yet. First, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Initiative">initiative</a>
is rolled as normal. Then, the first round of combat starts, and the
unsurprised combatants act in initiative order. A surprised creature
can’t move or take an action or a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
until its first turn ends (remember that being unable to take an action
also means you can’t take a bonus action). In effect, a surprised
creature skips its first turn in a fight. Once that turn ends, the
creature is no longer surprised.</p>
<p>In short, activity in a combat is always ordered by <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Initiative">initiative</a>,
whether or not someone is surprised, and after the first round of combat
has passed, surprise is no longer a factor. You can still try to hide
from your foes and gain the benefits conferred by being hidden, but you
don’t deprive your foes of their turns when you do so.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA112"></a>Surprise
rules work for two opposing sides. What happens with surprise when a
third group of combatants sneaks up, hidden from the melee, and
ambushes?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprise</a>
rule is relevant only when a combat is starting. Any ambushes during the
fight use the rules for Dexterity (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth">Stealth</a>)
checks.</p>
<h4

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA113"></a>If
a wizard casts a spell like <em>fireball</em> during a surprise round,
do the enemies get disadvantage on their saving throw?</h4>
<p>Being <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>
has no effect on saves. If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an
action on your first turn of the combat and you can’t take a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
until that turn ends.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA114"></a>Can
you delay your turn and take it later in the round?</h4>
<p>No. When it’s your turn, either you do something or you don’t. If you
don’t want to do anything, consider taking the <a

action so that you’ll, at least, have some extra protection. If you want
to wait to act in response to something, take the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready">Ready</a>
action, which lets you take part of your turn later.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, we didn’t include the option to delay your
turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your turn involves several decisions, including where to move and
what action to take. If you could delay your turn, your decision-making
would possibly become slower, since you would have to consider whether
you wanted to take your turn at all. Multiply that extra analysis by the
number of characters and monsters in a combat, and you have the
potential for many slowdowns in play.</li>
<li>The ability to delay your turn can make <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Initiative">initiative</a>
meaningless, as characters and monsters bounce around in the initiative
order. If combatants can change their place in the initiative order at
will, why use initiative at all? On top of that, changing initiative can
easily turn into an unwelcome chore, especially for the DM, who might
have to change the initiative list over and over during a fight.</li>
<li>Being able to delay your turn can let you wreak havoc on the
durations of spells and other effects, particularly any of them that
last until your next turn. Simply by changing when your turn happens,
you could change the length of certain spells. The way to guard against
such abuse would be to create a set of additional rules that would limit
your ability to change durations. The net effect? More complexity would
be added to the game, and with more complexity, there is greater
potential for slower play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of our goals for combat were for it to be speedy and for
initiative to matter. We didn’t want to start every combat by rolling <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Initiative">initiative</a>
and then undermine turn order with a delay option. Moreover, we felt
that toying with initiative wasn’t where the focus should be in battle.
Instead, the dramatic actions of the combatants should be the focus,
with turns that happen as quickly as possible.</p>

have a readied action. Can I stop readying to take an opportunity
attack? Or is ready a full turn commitment?</h4>
<p>If you have an action readied, you can make an opportunity attack,
which causes you to stop readying.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA116"></a>Can
a bonus action be used as an action or vice versa? For example, can a
bard use a bonus action to grant a Bardic Inspiration die and an action
to cast <em>healing</em> <em>word</em>?</h4>
<p>No. Actions and bonus actions aren’t interchangeable. In the example,
the bard could use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard#BardicInspiration-75">Bardic
Inspiration</a> or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word">healing word</a> on
a turn, not both.</p>

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA117"></a>Can
a flying creature without the hover trait stay in one place while
airborne, or does it need to move each round?</h4>
<p>A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#FlyingMovement">flyer</a>
that lacks the hover trait can stay aloft without moving each round.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA118"></a>Can
you move through the space of a prone enemy?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone">prone</a>
condition doesn’t override the rule that prevents you from moving
through an enemy’s space, unless that enemy is at least two sizes larger
or two sizes smaller than you.</p>
<p>If you do move through the space of another creature—whether a friend
or an enemy—the space is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain">difficult
terrain</a> for you, and you can’t willingly end your move there. See
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s

rogue/wizard can get a bonus action to Dash by using Cunning Action, and
I can cast <em>expeditious retreat</em> on myself to get a bonus action
to Dash. Do I get two bonus actions to Dash?</h4>
<p>No. You can take only one <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#BonusActions">bonus
action</a> on your turn. If you have two or more ways to use a bonus
action, you must choose which one (if any) you want to employ on your
turn.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA122"></a>If
you use the Help action to distract a foe, do you have to stay within 5
feet of it for the action to work?</h4>
<p>No, you can take the action and then move away. The action itself is
what grants <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">advantage</a>
to your ally, not your staying next to the foe.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA123"></a>If
I’m invisible and I become visible when I shoot an arrow at a target,
does hiding again require an action?</h4>
<p>Without a special ability, hiding in combat requires the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide">Hide</a>
action.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA124"></a>If
I use the Ready action to deal damage to someone who’s moving, do I deny
the target the rest of its movement?</h4>
<p>Dealing damage to a moving target doesn’t halt its movement, unless
the damage is accompanied by an ability that stops movement. Things like
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/sentinel">Sentinel</a> feat
give you such an ability. Reducing a moving creature to 0 <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit
points</a> is also usually an effective way to stop it!</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA125"></a>Can
you use the Ready action to take the Dash action on someone else’s turn
and then combine the Charger feat with it?</h4>
<p>No, since you can’t take a bonus action on someone else’s turn.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA126"></a>For
readying a spell or other action, does the target have to be in
range?</h4>
<p>Your target must be within range when you take a readied action, not
when you first ready it.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA127"></a>How
does readying a spell work? Do you lose your spell slot if the trigger
never occurs?</h4>
<p>A readied spell’s slot is lost if you don’t release the spell with
your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
before the start of your next turn.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA128"></a>Can
a readied action occur during an enemy’s triggering action, such as
between its first and second attacks when it uses Multiattack?</h4>
<p>A readied action occurs immediately after its trigger. If you defined
the trigger as an attack, your action happens after that attack.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA129"></a>How
do I know which ability modifier to use with an attack roll and its
damage roll?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a> specifies which ability modifier to use with an attack roll
(<em>PHB</em> “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#AttackRolls">Attack
Rolls</a>”) and which one to use with the corresponding damage roll
(<em>PHB</em> “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#DamageRolls">Damage
Rolls</a>”). Here’s a summary:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Attack Type</th>
<th>Attack Roll</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Melee weapon attack</td>
<td>Strength mod.*</td>
<td>Strength mod.</td>

<p>* Add your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a> if you’re using a weapon with which you’re proficient.</p>
<p>** Add your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a>. Your spellcasting ability is determined by your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>
or whatever feature gave you the ability to make the spell attack.</p>
<p>For example, if you make a melee weapon attack with a longsword, you
add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls of the attack.
In contrast, if you make the spell attack of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt">fire bolt</a> cantrip,
you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the attack roll. If you’re
a wizard, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability, so add your
Intelligence modifier. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt">Fire bolt</a> doesn’t
tell you to add your modifier to its damage roll, though, so you
don’t.</p>
<p>Various features in the game make explicit exceptions to the rule.
For example, a weapon that has the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">finesse</a>
property lets you choose whether to use your Strength or Dexterity
modifier with it. Another example: when you use the two-weapon fighting
option in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a> (<em>PHB</em> “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting">Two-Weapon
Fighting</a>”), you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the
bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. You do, however, still
add your ability modifier to the attack roll, since the option doesn’t
tell you not to. In other words, you follow the general rule until an
exception in the game tells you not to.</p>
<p>What about unusual cases like the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/green-flame-blade">green-flame
blade</a> spell? The spell, which appears in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s
Guide</a>, tells you to make a melee attack with a weapon. Look at the
table above, and you see that, under normal circumstances, you use your
Strength modifier when you make a melee weapon attack. It doesn’t matter
that a spell told you to attack. If a spell expects you to make a spell
attack, the spell’s description says so. For examples, take a look at <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt">fire bolt</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ray-of-frost">ray of frost</a>.
Both say it—“spell attack.”</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA130"></a>What
does “melee weapon attack” mean: a melee attack with a weapon or an
attack with a melee weapon?</h4>
<p>It means a melee attack with a weapon. Similarly, “ranged weapon
attack” means a ranged attack with a weapon. Some attacks count as a
melee or ranged weapon attack even if a weapon isn’t involved, as
specified in the text of those attacks. For example, an unarmed strike
counts as a melee weapon attack, even though the attacker’s body isn’t
considered a weapon.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit of wording minutia: we would write “melee-weapon attack”
(with a hyphen) if we meant an attack with a melee weapon.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA131"></a>How
does a reach weapon work with opportunity attacks?</h4>
<p>An <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a> is normally triggered when a creature you can see moves
beyond your reach. If you want to make an opportunity attack with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">reach</a>
weapon, such as a glaive or a halberd, you can do so when a creature
leaves the reach you have with that weapon. For example, if you’re
wielding a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/halberd">halberd</a>, a
creature that is right next to you could move 5 feet away without
triggering an opportunity attack. If that creature tries to move an
additional 5 feet—beyond your 10-foot reach—the creature then triggers
an opportunity attack.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA132"></a>Can
a blinded creature make an opportunity attack?</h4>
<p>An <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a> is triggered by “a hostile creature you can see”. If you
can’t see an enemy, you can’t make an opportunity attack against it.
Creatures with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight">blindsight</a>
are an exception to this rule, because that ability lets those creatures
“see” within a certain radius.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA133"></a>Can
an opportunity attack be used to make a grapple or a shove?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#Grappling">Grappling</a>
and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#ShovingaCreature">shoving</a>
are special melee attacks that require the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action. An <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a> is a special <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>.
Take the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready">Ready</a>
action if you want to attempt a grapple or a shove as a reaction.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA134"></a>When
you use two-weapon fighting, can you draw and throw two weapons on your
turn?</h4>
<p>You can throw two weapons with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting">two-weapon
fighting</a>, but that rule doesn’t give you the ability to draw two
weapons for free.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OtherActivityonYourTurn">interact
with one object for free</a>, either during your move or during an
action. One of the most common object interactions is drawing or stowing
a weapon. Interacting with a second object on the same turn requires an
action. You need a feature like the Dual Wielder feat to draw or stow a
second weapon for free.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA135"></a>With
two-weapon fighting, can I use both attacks (normal and bonus) to shove
a creature?</h4>
<p>No. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting">Two-weapon
fighting</a> doesn’t grant the bonus attack unless the first attack is
made with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">light</a>
melee weapon. Shoving a creature is a special melee attack that does not
involve the use of a weapon.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA136"></a>If
a creature is grappled, can it still attack and use its special
abilities?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled">grappled</a>
condition limits movement, not attacks, spellcasting, and the like. That
said, many grappling abilities, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16999-roper">roper’s</a>
tendril attack, also deliver effects like the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained">restrained</a>
condition.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA137"></a>Is
the grappling rule in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> usable by a
handless creature?</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#Grappling">grappling</a>
rule was written for a grappler with at least one hand, but a DM can
easily adapt the rule for a handless creature that has a bite or an
appendage, such as a tentacle, that could reasonably seize someone. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17062-wolf">wolf</a>, for
example, could plausibly try to seize a person with its bite, and the
animal wouldn’t be able to use its bite attack as long as it held onto
the person.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the grappling rule in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>
requires the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action, so a creature must take that action—rather than Multiattack or
another action in the creature’s stat block—when it uses that rule. A
monster, such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16999-roper">roper</a>, that
has a special grappling attack doesn’t follow that rule when using its
special attack.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA138"></a>Does
a grapple or a shove trigger the Tempest cleric’s Wrath of the Storm or
a Battle Master’s Riposte?</h4>
<p>The answer to both questions is no. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#Grappling">grappling</a>
and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#ShovingaCreature">shoving</a>
options don’t result in a hit or a miss.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA139"></a>Say
I grapple you, then I drop prone. Are we now prone together?</h4>
<p>No. A creature you’re <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#Grappling">grappling</a>
isn’t knocked <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone">prone</a>
if you become <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone">prone</a>.
You’re now holding onto the creature from a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone">prone</a>
position.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA140"></a>Target
at range caught in melee combat—does that target get some kind of cover
or do I get disadvantage?</h4>
<p>Your target has <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover">half
cover</a> if another creature is between you and the target.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA141"></a>Can
damage be reduced to 0 by resistance or another form of damage
reduction?</h4>
<p>There is no damage minimum in the rules, so it is possible to deal 0
damage with an attack, a spell, or another effect.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA142"></a>A
dragon uses a breath weapon against me. I succeed on the save, and I
have resistance to the damage. Do I take only one-quarter of the
damage?</h4>
<p>Yes, because <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#DamageResistanceandVulnerability">resistance</a>
is applied after all other modifiers to damage. If you succeed on a save
and still take damage, that damage is halved if you have the right
resistance.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA143"></a>Is
the intent that only melee weapon attacks can knock foes unconscious, or
can melee spell attacks as well?</h4>
<p>If you reduce a creature to 0 <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit
points</a> with a melee attack, you can <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#KnockingaCreatureOut">knock
the creature out</a>. That melee attack isn’t restricted to weapons.
Even a melee spell attack can be used to knock a creature out.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA144"></a>Are
attacks with a net always made with disadvantage?</h4>
<p>Unless you have a special ability that says otherwise, any <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/net">net</a> attack has <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage">disadvantage</a>
because you’re either <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#RangedAttacksinCloseCombat">within
5 feet of your target</a> or you’re attacking at long range, which is
between 5 and 15 feet for a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/net">net</a>.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA145"></a>Can
a non-Battle Master attempt to disarm someone?</h4>
<p>The Disarming Attack maneuver is designed for the Battle Master
archetype, but anyone can try to disarm a foe. The Disarm action option
(<em>DMG</em> , “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Disarm">Disarm</a>”)
provides one way a DM might adjudicate the activity.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA262"></a>Are
natural weapons considered weapons?</h4>
<p>Things designated as weapons by the rules, including natural weapons,
are indeed weapons. In contrast, unarmed strikes are not weapons. They
are something you do with an unarmed part of your body.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA263"></a>Can
I make an attack with one weapon, then draw a second weapon with my
other hand and qualify to use two-weapon fighting?</h4>
<p>To use the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting">two-weapon
fighting</a> bonus action (PH), you must have both weapons in hand when
you make the first attack. If you’re instead fighting with two or more
weapons as part of the Extra Attack feature, the rule for the two-weapon
fighting bonus action doesn’t apply. The rule for that bonus action
applies only to itself, not to any other use of two or more weapons in
the game.</p>
<h2 ><a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA146"></a>Can
a spellcaster cast spells off-target to minimize damage to party members
from a spell like <em>shatter</em>?</h4>
<p>The spellcaster chooses where to place the point of origin of a spell
like <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shatter">shatter</a> and
may, therefore, choose a position that is advantageous to allies.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA147"></a>Can
permanent magical effects be dispelled? Or are they no longer considered
magical effects once permanent?</h4>
<p>If the effect of a spell becomes permanent, it can be dispelled,
unless its description says otherwise (such as in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-stone">wall of stone</a>
spell).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA148"></a>Do
spellcasters have to learn a ritual version of a spell apart from the
normal version, or are they the same?</h4>
<p>To cast the ritual version of a spell you know, you need a feature,
such as Ritual Casting, that gives you the ability to cast the spell as
a ritual. You don’t need to also learn a special version of the
spell.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA149"></a>Can
spellcasters prepare spells not all at once, but prepare spells at
various times in the day?</h4>
<p>You prepare your list of spells only at the end of a long rest. You
can’t prepare some spells at the end of the rest and then prepare more
later.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA150"></a>Do
you always know when you’re under the effect of a spell?</h4>
<p>You’re aware that a spell is affecting you if it has a perceptible
effect or if its text says you’re aware of it (see <em>PHB</em> , under
“<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Targets">Targets</a>”).
Most spells are obvious. For example, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a> burns you,

heals you, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command">command</a> forces you
to suddenly do something you didn’t intend. Certain spells are more
subtle, yet you become aware of the spell at a time specified in the
spell’s description. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person">Charm person</a>
and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts">detect
thoughts</a> are examples of such spells.</p>
<p>Some spells are so subtle that you might not know you were ever under
their effects. A prime example of that sort of spell is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion">suggestion</a>.
Assuming you failed to notice the spellcaster casting the spell, you
might simply remember the caster saying, “The treasure you’re looking
for isn’t here. Go look for it in the room at the top of the next
tower.” You failed your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throw</a>, and off you went to the other tower, thinking it was your
idea to go there. You and your companions might deduce that you were
beguiled if evidence of the spell is found. It’s ultimately up to the DM
whether you discover the presence of inconspicuous spells. Discovery
usually comes through the use of skills like <a

I’m concentrating on a spell and I cast another spell that requires
concentration, when does my concentration on the first spell end?</h4>
<p>If you’re concentrating on a spell, your concentration on it ends
immediately when you start casting another spell that requires <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Concentration">concentration</a>.</p>

Attacks</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA151"></a>Is
a touch range spell considered a melee attack for purposes of subduing
foes rather than killing?</h4>
<p>Having a range of touch doesn’t mean a spell is a melee attack. A
spell tells you if it delivers such an attack.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA152"></a>Can
spell attacks score critical hits?</h4>
<p>A spell attack can definitely score a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CriticalHits">critical
hit</a>. The rule on critical hits applies to attack rolls of any
sort.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA153"></a>When
casting a spell that affects multiple targets, such as <em>scorching
ray</em> or <em>eldritch blast</em> , do I fire one ray or beam,
determine the result, and fire again? Or do I have to choose all the
targets before making any attack rolls?</h4>
<p>Even though the duration of each of these spells is instantaneous,
you choose the targets and resolve the attacks consecutively, not all at
once. If you want, you can declare all your targets before making any
attacks, but you would still roll separately for each attack (and
damage, if appropriate).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA154"></a>Can
a spell with an attack roll be used as the attack in the Attack action
or as part of the Extra Attack feature?</h4>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>As explained in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>, you
can take one action on your turn in combat, in addition to moving. You
choose your action from the options available to everyone—options such
as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>,
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CastaSpell">Cast
a Spell</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash">Dash</a>—or
you choose from among the special actions you’ve gained from a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>,
a feat, or another source.</p>
<p>If you want to cast a spell on your turn, you take the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CastaSpell">Cast
a Spell</a> action. Doing so means you’re not taking the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action or any other action. It is true that a number of spells, such as
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt">fire bolt</a> and
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ray-of-frost">ray of
frost</a>, involve making an attack, but you can’t make such an attack
without first casting the spell that delivers it. In other words, just
because something involves an attack doesn’t mean the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action is being used.</p>
<p>By extension, the Extra Attack feature (given by several classes,
including the fighter and paladin) doesn’t let you cast extra attack
spells. That feature specifically relies on the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action, not the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CastaSpell">Cast
a Spell</a> action or any other action.</p>
<p>In summary, to make a spell attack, you have to first cast a spell or
use a feature that creates the spell’s effect. A game feature, such as
Extra Attack, that lets you make an attack doesn’t let you cast a spell
unless it says it does.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA155"></a>Can
you use a melee spell attack to make an opportunity attack?</h4>
<p>You can’t if the spell attack is created by casting a spell. When a
creature triggers an opportunity attack from you, you can use your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
to make a melee attack against it. The opportunity attack doesn’t
suddenly give you the ability to cast a spell, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shocking-grasp">shocking
grasp</a>.</p>
<p>Each spell has a casting time. A game feature, such as an opportunity
attack, doesn’t let you bypass that casting time, unless the feature
says otherwise. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/war-caster">War Caster</a> feat is
an example of a feature that does let you bypass a 1-action casting time
to cast a spell in place of making an opportunity attack.</p>
<p>A few monsters can make opportunity attacks with melee spell attacks.
Here’s how: certain monsters—including the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17089-banshee">banshee</a>, the
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich">lich</a>, and
the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter">specter</a>—have
a melee spell attack that isn’t delivered by a spell. For example, the
banshee’s Corrupting Touch action is a melee spell attack but no spell
is cast to make it. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17089-banshee">banshee</a> can,
therefore, make opportunity attacks with Corrupting Touch.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA156"></a>Some
spells (like <em>eldritch blast</em> ) target a creature. Some others
(like <em>fire bolt</em> ) target objects too. Does this mean that I
can’t attack the door with <em>eldritch blast</em>?</h4>
<p>The target specifications (creature, object, or something else) in
spells are intentional.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA157"></a>Does
a melee spell attack count as a melee attack for Touch of Death?</h4>
<p>A melee spell attack is, indeed, a melee attack and can qualify for
the Death cleric’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#ChannelDivinity:TouchofDeath-597">Touch
of Death</a> feature.</p>
<h3 ><a

Level</h3>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA158"></a>What
level is a spell if you cast it without a spell slot?</h4>
<p>Such a spell is cast at its lowest possible level, which is the level
that appears near the top of its description. Unless you have a special
ability that says otherwise, the only way to increase the level of a
spell is to expend a higher-level spell slot when you cast it.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The warlock’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#EldritchInvocations-388">Chains
of Carceri</a> feature lets a warlock cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster">hold monster</a>
without using a spell slot. That casting of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster">hold monster</a>
is, therefore, 5th level, which is the lowest possible level for that
spell.</li>
<li>The warlock’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#EldritchInvocations-388">Thief
of Five Fates</a> feature lets a warlock cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bane">bane</a> using a spell
slot, which means the spell is 1st level or higher, depending on the
slot that the warlock expends to cast it.</li>
<li>The monk’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk#DiscipleoftheElements-250">Disciple
of the Elements</a> feature lets the monk spend ki points, rather than a
spell slot, to increase the level of a spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rule is true for player characters and monsters alike, which is
why the innate spellcasters in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a> must cast
an innate spell at its lowest possible level.</p>

Time</h3>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA159"></a>Is
there a limit on the number of spells you can cast on your turn?</h4>
<p>There’s no rule that says you can cast only X number of spells on
your turn, but there are some practical limits. The main limiting factor
is your action. Most spells require an action to cast, and unless you
use a feature like the fighter’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#ActionSurge-193">Action
Surge</a>, you have only one action on your turn.</p>
<p>If you cast a spell, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word">healing word</a>,
with a bonus action, you can cast another spell with your action, but
that other spell must be a cantrip. Keep in mind that this particular
limit is specific to spells that use a bonus action. For instance, if
you cast a second spell using <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#ActionSurge-193">Action
Surge</a>, you aren’t limited to casting a cantrip with it.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA160"></a>Does
the rule on casting a bonus action spell apply when you take a bonus
action granted by a spell?</h4>
<p>The rule on <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#BonusAction">casting
a spell as a bonus action</a> applies only on the turn you cast the
spell. For example, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon">spiritual
weapon</a> can be cast as a bonus action, and it lasts for 1 minute. On
the turn you cast it, you can’t cast another spell before or after it,
unless that spell is a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. Until <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon">spiritual
weapon</a> ends, it gives you the option of controlling its spectral
weapon as a bonus action. That bonus action does not involve casting a
spell, despite the fact that it’s granted by a spell, so you can control
the weapon and cast whatever spell you like on the same turn.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA161"></a>Can
you cast a reaction spell on your turn?</h4>
<p>You sure can! Here’s a common way for it to happen: Cornelius the
wizard is casting <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a> on his
turn, and his foe casts <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a> on
him. Cornelius also has <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a>
prepared, so he uses his <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Reactions">reaction</a>
to cast it and break his foe’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a>
before it can stop <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a>.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA162"></a>Does
casting a spell as a ritual require concentration if the spell doesn’t
normally require it?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration">Concentration</a>
is required when casting any spell, including a ritual version, for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#LongerCastingTimes">longer
than 1 action</a>. Once the casting is complete, the spell requires
concentration only if its duration entry says it does.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#Components"></a>Components</h3>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA163"></a>Does
a spell consume its material components?</h4>
<p>A spell doesn’t consume its material components unless its
description says it does. For example, the pearl required by the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify">identify</a> spell
isn’t consumed, whereas the diamond required by <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead">raise dead</a> is
used up when you cast the spell.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA164"></a>If
a spell’s material components are consumed, can a spellcasting focus
still be used in place of the consumed component?</h4>
<p>No. A spellcasting focus can be used in place of a material component
only if that component has no cost noted in the spell’s description and
if that component isn’t consumed.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA165"></a>What’s
the amount of interaction needed to use a spellcasting focus? Does it
have to be included in the somatic component?</h4>
<p>If a spell has a material component, you need to handle that <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Components">component</a>
when you cast the spell. The same rule applies if you’re using a
spellcasting focus as the material component.</p>
<p>If a spell has a somatic component, you can use the hand that
performs the somatic component to also handle the material component.
For example, a wizard who uses an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/orb">orb</a> as a spellcasting
focus could hold a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>
in one hand and the orb in the other, and he could cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt">lightning
bolt</a> by using the orb as the spell’s material component and the orb
hand to perform the spell’s somatic component.</p>
<p>Another example: a cleric’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/holy-symbol">holy symbol</a>
is emblazoned on her <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield">shield</a>. She likes
to wade into melee combat with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/mace">mace</a> in one hand and
a shield in the other. She uses the holy symbol as her spellcasting
focus, so she needs to have the shield in hand when she casts a cleric
spell that has a material component. If the spell, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/aid">aid</a>, also has a somatic
component, she can perform that component with the shield hand and keep
holding the mace in the other.</p>
<p>If the same cleric casts <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds">cure wounds</a>, she
needs to put the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/mace">mace</a> or the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield">shield</a> away,
because that spell doesn’t have a material component but does have a
somatic component. She’s going to need a free hand to make the spell’s
gestures. If she had the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/war-caster">War Caster</a> feat,
she could ignore this restriction.</p>
<h3 ><a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA166"></a>If
you’re concentrating on a spell, do you need to maintain line of sight
with the spell’s target or the spell’s effect?</h4>
<p>You don’t need to be within line of sight or within range to maintain
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration">concentration</a>
on a spell, unless a spell’s description or other game feature says
otherwise.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA167"></a>If
I have 10 temporary hit points and I take 30 damage from an attack while
concentrating on a spell, what is the DC of the Constitution save to
maintain my concentration?</h4>
<p>The DC is 15 in that case. When <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> absorb damage for you, you’re still taking damage, just
not to your real <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit
points</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, a feature like the wizard’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard#ArcaneWard-416">Arcane
Ward</a> can take damage for you, potentially eliminating the need to
make a Constitution <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">saving
throw</a> or, at least, lowering the DC of that save.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA168"></a>Can
a spellcaster dismiss a spell after casting it?</h4>
<p>You can’t normally dismiss a spell that you cast unless (a) its
description says you can or (b) it requires <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration">concentration</a>
and you decide to end your concentration on it. Otherwise, a spell’s
magic is unleashed on the environment, and if you want to end it, you
need to cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> on
it.</p>
<h3 ><a

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA265"></a>Can
I cast <em>animate dead</em> on the humanoid-shaped corpse of an undead
creature such as a zombie or a ghast?</h4>
<p>When <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-dead">animate
dead</a> targets a corpse, the body must have belonged to a creature of
the humanoid creature type.</p>
<p>If the spell targets a pile of bones, there is no creature type
restriction; the bones become a skeleton.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA266"></a>Does
casting <em>animate objects</em> during a time stop spell end the time
stop?</h4>
<p>No. Commanding the newly created creatures with your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#BonusActions">bonus
action</a> does end <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/time-stop">time stop</a>,
however.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA169"></a>Can
you extend the duration of <em>armor of Agathys</em> by gaining more
temporary hit points?</h4>
<p>The spell is meant to work only as long as you have the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> that the spell grants. When those temporary hit points
are gone, the spell is done.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> aren’t cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and
receive more of them, you don’t add them together, unless a game feature
says you can. You decide which temporary hit points to keep. As an
example, let’s say you’re a warlock with the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#DarkOne%E2%80%99sBlessing-401">Dark
One’s Blessing</a> feature, which gives you temporary hit points when
you reduce a creature to 0 <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit
points</a>. You currently have 2 temporary hit points remaining from <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/armor-of-agathys">armor of
Agathys</a>, you just slew a monster, and your Dark One’s Blessing can
now give you 4 temporary hit points. If you take those temporary hit
points, they replace the ones from <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/armor-of-agathys">armor of
Agathys</a> and end that spell, so you might not want to take them and
keep the spell going instead, so as to continue benefiting from the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#DamageTypes">cold
damage</a> it delivers.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA170"></a>How
does <em>barkskin</em> work with shields, cover, and other modifiers to
AC?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin">Barkskin</a>
specifies that your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#ArmorClass">AC</a>
can’t be lower than 16 while you are affected by the spell. This means
you effectively ignore any modifiers to your AC—including your Dexterity
modifier, your armor, a shield, and cover—unless your AC is higher than
16. For example, if your AC is normally 14, it’s 16 while <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin">barkskin</a> is on you.
If your AC is normally 15 and you have <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover">half
cover</a>, your AC is 17; <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin">barkskin</a> isn’t

the <em>chill touch</em> spell intended as a way of foiling any creature

none of the <a

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA175"></a>When
you cast a spell like <em>conjure woodland beings</em> , does the
spellcaster or the DM choose the creatures that are conjured?</h4>
<p>A number of spells in the game let you summon creatures. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-animals">Conjure
animals</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-celestial">conjure
celestial</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-minor-elementals">conjure
minor elementals</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-woodland-beings">conjure
woodland beings</a> are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Some spells of this sort specify that the spellcaster chooses the
creature conjured. For example, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar">find familiar</a>
gives the caster a list of animals to choose from.</p>
<p>Other spells of this sort let the spellcaster choose from among
several broad options. For example, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-minor-elementals">conjure
minor elementals</a> offers four options. Here are the first two:</p>
<ul>
<li>One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
<li>Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
</ul>
<p>The design intent for options like these is that the spellcaster
chooses one of them, and then the DM decides what creatures appear that
fit the chosen option. For example, if you pick the second option, the
DM chooses the two elementals that have a challenge rating of 1 or
lower.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can certainly express a preference for what creatures
shows up, but it’s up to the DM to determine if they do. The DM will
often choose creatures that are appropriate for the campaign and that
will be fun to introduce in a scene.</p>

<p>No. The <a

dispel only a light-creating spell of 2nd level or lower, no matter what
spell slot is used for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkness">darkness</a>.

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA179"></a>Can
you use <em>dispel magic</em> to dispel a magical effect like a
vampire’s Charm ability or a druid’s Wild Shape?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">Dispel
magic</a> has a particular purpose: to break other spells. It has no
effect on a vampire’s Charm ability or any other magical effect that
isn’t a spell. It also does nothing to the properties of a magic item.
It can, however, end a spell cast from a magic item or from another
source. Spells—they’re what <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> is
about. For example, if you cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> on
a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4764-staff-of-power">staff
of power</a>, the spell fails to disrupt the staff’s magical properties,
but if the staff’s wielder casts <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster">hold monster</a>
from the staff, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>
can end that spell if cast on the target of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster">hold
monster</a>.</p>
<p>There are abilities and other spells that can end or suspend magical
effects that aren’t spells. For example, the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration">greater
restoration</a> spell can end a charm effect of any sort on a target
(such as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17043-vampire">vampire’s</a>
Charm or a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16849-dryad">dryad’s</a> Fey
Charm), and a paladin’s <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#AuraofDevotion-280">Aura
of Devotion</a> can prevent or suspend such an effect.</p>
<p>Three of the most versatile spells for ending certain magical effects
are <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration">lesser
restoration</a>, <a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA180"></a>Can
you use <em>dispel magic</em> on the creations of a spell like
<em>animate dead</em> or affect those creations with <em>antimagic
field</em>?</h4>
<p>Whenever you wonder whether a spell’s effects can be dispelled or
suspended, you need to answer one question: is the spell’s duration
instantaneous? If the answer is yes, there is nothing to dispel or
suspend. Here’s why: the effects of an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Instantaneous">instantaneous
spell</a> are brought into being by magic, but the effects aren’t
sustained by magic. The magic flares for a split second and then
vanishes. For example, the instantaneous spell <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-dead">animate dead</a>
harnesses magical energy to turn a corpse or a pile of bones into an
undead creature. That necromantic magic is present for an instant and is
then gone. The resulting undead now exists without the magic’s help.
Casting <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel
magic</a> on the creature can’t end its mockery of life, and the undead
can wander into an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field">antimagic
field</a> with no adverse effect.</p>
<p>Another example: <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds">cure wounds</a>
instantaneously restores <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#HitPoints">hit
points</a> to a creature. Because the spell’s duration is instantaneous,
the restoration can’t be later dispelled. And you don’t suddenly lose
hit points if you step into an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field">antimagic
field</a> !</p>
<p>In contrast, a spell like <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-woodland-beings">conjure
woodland beings</a> has a non-instantaneous duration, which means its
creations can be ended by <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>
and they temporarily disappear within an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field">antimagic
field</a> .</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA181"></a>Can
you ready <em>dispel magic</em> to stop another spell from taking
effect?</h4>
<p>The easiest way to stop a spell is to cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a> on
its caster while it’s being cast. If successful, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a>
interrupts the other spell’s casting, and that spell fails to take
effect. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">Counterspell</a>
works against any spell, regardless of a spell’s casting time or
duration.</p>
<p>With the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready">Ready</a>
action, dispel magic can be cast in response to another spell being
cast, yet <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel
magic</a> can’t substitute for <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">counterspell</a>.
The main reason is that <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>
removes a spell that is already on a target, whether that target is a
creature, an object, or some other phenomenon. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">Dispel magic</a>
can’t dispel something in advance. If a spell isn’t already present on a
target, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel
magic</a> does nothing to that target. The best that a readied <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>
can do is dispel a spell immediately after the spell has been cast to
prevent it from having any effect after the action used to cast it. For
example, on your turn you could say something like this: “I ready <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>,
and if the high priest casts a spell on anyone, I cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> on
the target if the spell takes hold.” If the high priest then cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-person">hold person</a> on
your companion who fails the save against it, you could unleash your
readied <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic">dispel
magic</a> and end <a

you use <em>green-flame blade</em> and <em>booming blade</em> with Extra
Attack, opportunity attacks, Sneak Attack, and other weapon attack
options?</h4>
<p>Introduced in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s
Guide</a> , the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/green-flame-blade">green-flame
blade</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/booming-blade">booming blade</a>
spells pose a number of questions, because they each do something
unusual: require you to make a melee attack with a weapon as part of the
spell’s casting.</p>
<p>First, each of these spells involves a normal melee weapon attack,
not a spell attack, so you use whatever ability modifier you normally
use with the weapon. (A spell tells you if it includes a spell attack,
and neither of these spells do.) For example, if you use a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/longsword">longsword</a> with
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/green-flame-blade">green-flame
blade</a>, you use your Strength modifier for the weapon’s attack and
damage rolls.</p>
<p>Second, neither <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/green-flame-blade">green-flame
blade</a> nor <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/booming-blade">booming blade</a>
works with Extra Attack or any other feature that requires the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack">Attack</a>
action. Like other spells, these cantrips require the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CastaSpell">Cast
a Spell</a> action, not the Attack action, and they can’t be used to
make an opportunity attack, unless a special feature allows you to do
so.</p>
<p>Third, these weapon attacks work with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#SneakAttack-343">Sneak
Attack</a> if they fulfill the normal requirements for that feature. For
example, if you have the Sneak Attack feature and cast <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/green-flame-blade">green-flame
blade</a> with a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">finesse</a>
weapon, you can deal Sneak Attack damage to the target of the weapon
attack if you have <a

meant to add together the temporary hit points it provides. At the start
of each of your turns, the spell, effectively, refreshes the number of
temporary hit points you have from it; if you lost some or all of the
temporary hit points, the spell gives them back to you.</p>

resting identifies magic items, and the <em>identify</em> spell doesn’t
spot curses, what is the role of the <em>identify</em> spell?</h4>
<p>The most important factors are time and convenience. During a short
rest, which takes at least 1 hour, a character who meets the
qualifications can determine the properties of one magic item (see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#IdentifyingaMagicItem">Identifying
a Magic Item</a>” in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s
Guide</a>). In contrast, casting the <a

takes only 1 minute (or 11 minutes if it is cast as a ritual) and can be
done when a quick determination is needed.</p>
<h4
>What
happens when a jump spell gives a creature a jump distance greater than

<p>Your jump is limited by how far you can <a

travelling overland travel</a>; each foot jumped uses a foot of
movement. You can take the <a href="Dash.html">Dash</a> action if you want
to extend how far you can move on your turn.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a Strength score of 15, you can normally
leap 15 feet when you make a long jump if you move at least 10 feet
immediately beforehand. If the <a href="5e%20spell%20jump%20w.html">5e
spell jump w</a> spell is cast on you, that potential jump distance is
tripled. That’s a jump of 45 feet! If your speed is 30 feet, you can use
only 30 feet of that jump distance on your turn, unless you take the
dash action, which allows you to leap the full 45 feet.

are grouped with armor in the equipment rules in the <a

various game features distinguish between the armor you wear and a
shield you wield. Take a look at the monk’s <a

<p>An illusory object created by <a

<em>moonbeam</em> deal damage when you cast it? What about when its
effect moves onto a creature?</h4>
<p>The answer to both questions is no. Here’s some elaboration on that
answer.</p>
<p>Some spells and other game features create an area of effect that
does something when a creature enters that area for the first time on a
turn or when a creature starts its turn in that area. On the turn when
you cast such a spell, you’re primarily setting up hurt for your foes on
later turns. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam">Moonbeam</a>, for
example, creates a beam of light that can damage a creature who enters
the beam or who starts its turn in the beam.</p>
<p>Here are some spells with the same timing as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam">moonbeam</a> for their
areas of effect:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blade-barrier">blade
barrier</a></p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cloudkill">cloudkill</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cloud-of-daggers">cloud of
daggers</a></p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/evards-black-tentacles">Evard’s
black tentacles</a></p>
<p><a

storm</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spirit-guardians">spirit
guardians</a></p>
<p>Reading the description of any of those spells, you might wonder
whether a creature is considered to be entering the spell’s area of
effect if the area is created on the creature’s space. And if the area
of effect can be moved—as the beam of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam">moonbeam</a> can—does
moving it into a creature’s space count as the creature entering the
area? Our design intent for such spells is this: a creature enters the
area of effect when the creature passes into it. Creating the area of
effect on the creature or moving it onto the creature doesn’t count. If
the creature is still in the area at the start of its turn, it is
subjected to the area’s effect.</p>
<p>Entering such an area of effect needn’t be voluntary, unless a spell
says otherwise. You can, therefore, hurl a creature into the area with a
spell like <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave">thunderwave</a>. We
consider that clever play, not an imbalance, so hurl away! Keep in mind,
however, that a creature is subjected to such an area of effect only the
first time it enters the area on a turn. You can’t move a creature in
and out of it to damage it over and over again on the same turn.</p>
<p>In summary, a spell like <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam">moonbeam</a> affects a
creature when the creature passes into the spell’s area of effect and
when the creature starts its turn there. You’re essentially creating a
hazard on the battlefield.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA274"></a>What
happens to objects brought inside and left inside Mordenkainen’s
magnificent mansion when the spell ends?</h4>
<p>The intent is that the objects are ejected from the <a

when the spell ends and appear in unoccupied spaces closest to where the
door was. This intent will be reflected in future printings of the <a

you concentrate on a spell while transformed by <em>polymorph</em>?</h4>
<p>You can’t cast spells while you’re transformed by <a

nothing in the spell prevents you from concentrating on a spell that you
previously cast before being transformed.</p>

a willing creature under the effects of <em>polymorph</em> have to take

<p>Yes. Unless a spell tells you otherwise, its effect is no different
for a willing creature than it is for an unwilling one.</p>

a creature under the effects of <em>polymorph</em> takes enough fire

<p>When the creature reverts to its true form, any leftover damage is
subject to that form’s <a

<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph">Polymorph</a>
replaces only the target’s character sheet or stat block with the stat
block of the chosen form. Other effects, such as other spells, still

<p>The benefit from <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/polearm-master">Polearm Master</a>
applies to the opposite end of the weapon and always uses a d4 for
damage rather than the weapon’s normal damage die. This is true for a <a

enhanced with <a

as it is for a normal one.</p>

a spellcaster is affected by <em>slow</em> and takes two turns to finish
casting a spell, what happens if their target has moved out of range or

<p>You choose the targets of a spell when you complete casting a spell,
not when you start. (<a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA209"></a>The
<em>stinking cloud</em> spell says that a creature wastes its action on
a failed save. So can it still use a move or a bonus action or a
reaction?</h4>
<p>Correct. The gas doesn’t immobilize a creature or prevent it from
acting altogether, but the effect of the spell does limit what it can
accomplish while the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stinking-cloud">cloud</a>
lingers.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA210"></a>Do
the effects of <em>storm of vengeance</em> stack? Or do the effects
change each turn?</h4>
<p>In the spell <a

round.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA211"></a>Is
the sentence of suggestion in the <em>suggestion</em> spell the verbal
component, or is the verbal component separate?</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#VerbalV">Verbal
components</a> are mystic words, not normal speech. The spell’s
suggestion is an intelligible utterance that is separate from the verbal
component. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command">command</a> spell is the
simplest example of this principle. The utterance of the verbal
component is separate from, and precedes, any verbal utterance that
would bring about the spell’s effect.</p>

wording in <em>Tasha’s hideous laughter</em> implies that the

right?</h4>
<p>Failing a save against <a

you are affecting a target with <em>telekinesis</em> and an ally put you

the target or other targets with the existing telekinesis spell?</h4>
<p>You can maintain your <a

on a target you were already affecting, but you can’t affect a new
target. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/otilukes-resilient-sphere">sphere</a>

I use <em>unseen servant</em> to act as an ally when using a class

<p>If you cast <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish">wish</a>
to duplicate a spell of level 0–8, there are no detrimental effects.
However, if you do anything other than duplicate a spell of level 0–8,
you suffer the stress described in the final paragraph of the spell. As
soon as that stress affects you, there is a 33 percent chance that you
are unable to cast <a

<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA215"></a>Is
natural armor considered light armor?</h4>
<p>No. Natural armor doesn’t fit into the categories of light, medium,

armor you’re wearing.</p>
<h4 ><a

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA217"></a>A
monster is immune to damage from nonmagical bludgeoning weapons. Does it
still take damage from falling?</h4>
<p>Yes, that monster is still going to feel the hurt of a <a

because a fall is not a weapon.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA218"></a>What
actions can monsters use to make opportunity attacks? Are Multiattack
and breath weapon actions allowed?</h4>
<p>A monster follows the normal <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack rules</a>, which specify that an attack of opportunity is one
melee attack. That means a monster must choose a single melee attack to
make, either an attack in its stat block or a generic attack, like an
unarmed strike. Multiattack doesn’t qualify, not only because it’s more
than one attack, but also because the rule on Multiattack (<em>MM</em> ,
“<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction#Multiattack">Multiattack</a>”)
states that this action can’t be used for opportunity attacks. An
action, such as a breath weapon, that doesn’t include an attack roll is
also not eligible.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA219"></a>The
bite attacks of ghouls and ghasts don’t appear to have proficiency bonus

<p>Intentional; it’s a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16872-ghoul">ghoul</a>/<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16870-ghast">ghast</a> thing.
They’re exceptionally bad at biting, compared to their claw attacks.
Monsters sometimes have stat quirks like that.</p>

<em>Monster Manual</em> says gnolls speak Gnoll, but the <em>Player’s
Handbook</em> doesn’t mention that language. What is correct?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a> language tables don’t list every language in the D&amp;D
multiverse. The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster
Manual</a> mentions other languages, including Gnoll, Modron, Sahuagin,
and Slaad.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA221"></a>Does
a monster with at-will spellcasting ability mean it can cast a spell as
an action or as a bonus action?</h4>
<p>If a monster has the ability to cast a spell at will, that spell is
cast using its normal casting time.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA222"></a>If
a monster makes a melee attack that uses its Dexterity modifier, is it
considered to have used a finesse weapon?</h4>
<p>A weapon doesn’t have the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties">finesse</a>
property unless its description says so, and using Dexterity for an
attack doesn’t confer the finesse property. If a weapon does have that
property, you can use Strength or Dexterity with it.</p>

<em>Monster Manual</em> notes that a Mezzoloth exhales toxic fumes that
can choke and kill whole groups of creatures. However, its
<em>cloudkill</em> is listed under Innate Spellcasting. Because of that,
would a paladin’s Aura of Warding resist it?</h4>
<p>Yes, because <a

spell, <a

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4574-armor-of-invulnerability">armor
of invulnerability</a>, or use another feature of the game that protects
against magical or nonmagical effects, you might ask yourself, “Will
this protect me against a dragon’s breath?” The breath weapon of a
typical dragon isn’t considered magical, so <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field">antimagic
field</a> won’t help you but <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4574-armor-of-invulnerability">armor
of invulnerability</a> will.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Dragons seem pretty magical to me.” And yes,
they are extraordinary! Their description even says they’re magical. But
our game makes a distinction between two types of magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>the background magic that is part of the D&amp;D multiverse’s
physics and the physiology of many D&amp;D creatures</li>
<li>the concentrated magical energy that is contained in a magic item or
channeled to create a spell or other focused magical effect</li>
</ul>
<p>In D&amp;D, the first type of magic is part of nature. It is no more
dispellable than the wind. A monster like a dragon exists because of
that magic-enhanced nature. The second type of magic is what the rules
are concerned about. When a rule refers to something being magical, it’s
referring to that second type. Determining whether a game feature is
magical is straightforward. Ask yourself these questions about the
feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a magic item?</li>
<li>Is it a spell? Or does it let you create the effects of a spell
that’s mentioned in its description?</li>
<li>Is it a spell attack?</li>
<li>Is it fueled by the use of spell slots?</li>
<li>Does its description say it’s magical?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to any of those questions is yes, the feature is
magical.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16773-adult-white-dragon">white
dragon’s</a> Cold Breath and ask ourselves those questions. First, Cold
Breath isn’t a magic item. Second, its description mentions no spell.
Third, it’s not a spell attack. Fourth, the word “magical” appears
nowhere in its description. Our conclusion: Cold Breath is not
considered a magical game effect, even though we know that dragons are
amazing, supernatural beings.</p>

<p>No. A <a

one that reduces the target’s <a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA232"></a>Is
there a limit to the number of creatures a vampire can charm at
once?</h4>
<p>No, there is no limit on the number of creatures a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17043-vampire">vampire</a> can
have charmed at once. A vampire can target a different humanoid each
time it uses its Charm action, potentially causing an entire group of
enemies to become charmed if their <a

throws</a> aren’t successful.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA233"></a>How
does a monster’s Leadership ability work?</h4>
<p>A creature turns on Leadership as an action. Until the benefit ends,
the creature can grant a die whenever a visible ally in range makes an
attack roll or a <a

throw</a>.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA283"></a>Does
a gauth’s Devour Magic eye ray end a creature’s attunement to an attuned
magic item the ray affects?</h4>
<p>No. (<a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA284"></a>Can
a creature that burrows grapple a target and drag them into the ground
by burrowing?</h4>
<p>No. A burrowing creature can drag another creature with them only if
they have the ability to leave a tunnel. For example, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16987-purple-worm">purple
worm</a> has the Tunneler trait, so it can drag a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled">grappled</a>
creature into a tunnel it creates when burrowing. Conversely, an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16853-earth-elemental">earth
elemental</a> can’t drag a creature into the ground with it.</p>

><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA285"></a>Can
a hydra use Reactive Heads to make multiple opportunity attacks against
one creature at the same time when it provokes?</h4>
<p>Yes. For that reason, we recommend taking the <a

action when you’re going to move away from a <a

<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA234"></a>Can
potions be administered to unconscious characters as an action?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can administer a potion to someone else as an action
(<em>DMG</em>, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Potions">Potions</a>”).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA235"></a>If
a potion doesn’t duplicate a spell, does it require concentration?</h4>
<p>A potion’s effect requires <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration">concentration</a>
only if its description says so or if it duplicates a spell that
requires concentration.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA236"></a>For
the hat of disguise, how do I set the spell save DC for <em>disguise
self</em> ? Does the wearer have to be a caster?</h4>
<p>Use your spellcasting ability modifier to set the DC. If you don’t
have a spellcasting ability, use your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus">proficiency
bonus</a> to set it (see the rule in the <em>DMG</em> , under “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Spells">Spells</a>”).</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA237"></a>Which
is correct in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, the rule for scrolls
or the rule for a <em>spell scroll</em>?</h4>
<p>They’re both correct. The rule for scrolls (<em>DMG</em> “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Scrolls">Scrolls</a>”)
is for scrolls in general, including a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5398-scroll-of-protection">scroll
of protection</a>, and it allows you to try to activate a spell if
you’re literate. The rule for a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll">spell
scroll</a> is specific to that type of scroll and introduces an
additional requirement: the spell on the scroll must be on your class’s
spell list for you to read the scroll.</p>
<p>A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll">spell
scroll</a> can be named in a variety of ways: spell scroll , scroll of X
(where X is the name of a spell), or spell scroll of X (where X , again,
is the name of a spell). No matter how its name appears, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll">spell
scroll</a> follows the same rule.</p>
<p>For you to meet a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll">spell
scroll’s</a> requirement, the spell on the scroll needs to be on
whatever spell list is used by your <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes">class</a>.
Here are two examples. If you’re a cleric, the spell must be on the
cleric spell list, and if you’re a fighter with the Eldritch Knight
archetype, the spell must be on the wizard spell list, because that is
the spell list used by your class.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA238"></a>Do
the AC bonuses from a <em>ring of protection</em> and <em>bracers of
defense</em> stack?</h4>
<p>Yes. In general, bonuses stack, unless they’re from the same spell
(see “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#CombiningMagicalEffects">Combining
Magical Effects</a>” in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>). You
also can’t benefit from more than one <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection">ring
of protection</a>, for instance, since you can’t attune to more than one
copy of an item at a time.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA239"></a>Do
magic weapons give you a bonus to attack and damage rolls?</h4>
<p>A magic weapon gives you a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
only if its description says it does. Every magic weapon can bypass
resistances and immunities to damage from nonmagical attacks, but only
certain magic weapons are more accurate and damaging than their
nonmagical counterparts. For example, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5245-longsword-1">+1
longsword</a> and a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5388-giant-slayer">giant
slayer</a> both give you a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls,
whereas neither a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5386-flame-tongue">flame
tongue</a> nor a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5387-frost-brand">frost
brand</a> provides such a bonus. All four weapons, however, can bypass
an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16853-earth-elemental">earth
elemental’s</a> <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#DamageResistanceandVulnerability">resistance</a>
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical
attacks.</p>
<p>In short, a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls is considered a
special property of a magic weapon, not something that all magic weapons
provide automatically.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA240"></a>My
fighter attacks a creature with a magical longbow and nonmagical arrows.
Is the attack magical?</h4>
<p>The attacks made by a magical ranged weapon are magical, even if the
ammunition isn’t magical. (This point was clarified in the errata for
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s
Guide</a>.)</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA241"></a>Are
magic weapons with the thrown property (javelins and the like) assumed
to return to their owner after being thrown?</h4>
<p>If a magic weapon returns to you after you throw it, its description
says so, as in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4627-dwarven-thrower">dwarven
thrower</a>.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA242"></a>If
a rogue with the Assassinate feature uses a <em>vorpal sword</em>, isn’t
the surprise attack an instant kill?</h4>
<p>No. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5397-vorpal-sword">vorpal
sword</a> requires you to roll a 20 on the attack roll to decapitate
someone. A rogue with the Assassin archetype that attacks a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>
target using a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5397-vorpal-sword">vorpal
sword</a> scores an automatic <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#CriticalHits">critical
hit</a> if the attack roll is successful, but unless the attack roll was
a 20, the target gets to keep its head.</p>

an elf get a saving throw versus a <em>philter of love</em> as it’s a

<p>There is no save against the <a

of love</a>. The love is just that strong.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA286"></a>Does
the <em>ring of the ram</em> use spell attacks or weapon attacks?</h4>
<p>The text doesn’t specify. The attack of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4734-ring-of-the-ram">ring
of the ram</a> is a ranged spell attack. Future printings of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>
will reflect that intent.</p>

using a <em>rope of entanglement</em>, do I keep holding one end in my

<p>You are still holding the <a

while the other end entangles the target.</p>

<p>Yes, but only the magical +2, which says you gain it when holding the

You gain the shield’s base AC bonus only if you use your action to don
the shield as normal (see “<a

Questions</h2>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA291"></a>Recent
books include monster stat blocks—like the dragon blessed in
<em>Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons</em> and the Silverquill apprentice in
<em>Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos</em>—that contain actions
designated as spell attacks, rather than weapon attacks. What was the
motivation for adding this type of action to the game?</h4>
<p>This type of action isn’t new. Monsters have had spell attacks since
the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>
(2014). See the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich">lich’s</a>
Paralyzing Touch action and the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17137-cambion">cambion’s</a>
Fire Ray action for other examples of actions that are spell attacks. As
discussed in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction">introduction</a>
of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster
Manual</a>, a monster’s attack action is designated as either a weapon
attack or a spell attack.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA292"></a>Is
a spell attack a spell?</h4>
<p>No. The game has two types of attacks—weapon attacks and spell
attacks—so a spell attack is a type of attack, not a type of spell.
Sometimes a spell attack is part of a spell, as in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt">fire bolt</a> spell,
but other times a spell attack occurs outside a spell, as in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter">specter’s</a>
Life Drain attack in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA293"></a>When
a monster casts a spell without using spell slots, how do I know the
spell’s level?</h4>
<p>A spell’s level is specified in the spell’s description. For example,
the description of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball">fireball</a> says it’s
a 3rd-level spell. If you cast spells using spell slots, you get the
additional option of temporarily increasing a spell’s level by expending
a spell lot of a higher level to cast the spell.</p>
<h4
><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA294"></a>Can
the <em>silvery barbs</em> spell in <em>Strixhaven</em> affect Legendary
Resistance?</h4>
<p>No. When a creature uses Legendary Resistance, the creature turns a
failed saving throw into a success, regardless of the number rolled on
the d20. Forcing that creature to reroll the d20 afterward doesn’t
change the fact that the save succeeded as a result of Legendary
Resistance. No amount of rerolling will undo that success.</p>
