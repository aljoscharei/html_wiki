<p>Casting Time: 1 hour Range: 10 ft. Components: V, S Duration:
Special</p>
<p>You create a fortress of living trees and thorny bushes that erupt
from the local growth. The fortress is approximately 20 feet on a side
and no higher than 20 feet. Its exact layout is determined by the
caster. Each wall and the canopy roof have 50 hit points, AC 15,
resistance to non-magical piercing damage and immunity to poison and
psychic damage. At the start of a round, a damaged section regenerates 5
hit points of damage.</p>
<p>You can allow creatures of your choice to enter or exit the fortress
and teach them special words to allow them passage even if youâ€™re not
there. Inside the fortress it is always dry and a comfortable
temperature. Other creatures who attempt to enter (or leave) the
fortress must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 piercing damage
on a failure or half that on a success.</p>
<p>The fortress lives a season (three months) and then the spell must be
cast again or the magic will fade and it will start to wither away.</p>
