<p>FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT</p>
<p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret
door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom <a
href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills Perception</a> check. Such
a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and
clues that you might otherwise overlook.</p>
<p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order
for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is
hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If
you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and
furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless
of your Wisdom <a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills
Perception</a> check result. You would have to specify that you were
opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance
of success.</p>
