<h1 >Conjure Elemental</h1>
<p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay
for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for
water)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth,
fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of
challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in
an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental
emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.
The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
ends.<br />
The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you
don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from
hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.<br />
If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward
you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental
can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned
it. The GM has the elemental’s statistics.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1
for each slot level above 5th.</p>

An elemental hero under the caster’s control is placed on the map. The
elemental is an independent hero with AC 11, UHD16, uhp1, AT 1 slam 2+,
ML +4. It is immune to non-magical weapons. Movement and formation
depend on the type of elemental:</p>
<p>» Air:Movementrate3/6/12(FLY).<br />
» Earth:Movementrate1/2/3(FF).<br />
» Fire: Movement rate 2/4/6 (LM).<br />
» Water: Movement rate 1/2/3 (LM). Water elementals</p>
<p>may move over water at three times normal speed.</p>
<p>The elemental hero moves and attacks during the caster’s movement and
attack sequences. The caster may not himself move or attack while
controlling the elemental. If the caster moves or takes damage he loses
control of the elemental. If the caster loses control of the elemental,
it will immediately move towards him as fast as possible and will attack
him until destroyed.</p>

<p>A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water
is opened, allowing the arcane spellcaster to summon an elemental from
that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the
caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the
conjurer indefinitely, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing
but controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over
half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. See the entry
under <a href="ACKS%20Chapter08%20Monsters.md#elemental">Elementals</a>
in the Monsters chapter for statistics for the conjured elemental. The
conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native
plane at will (doing so on his Initiative if in combat). If the arcane
spellcaster loses concentration, control of the summoned elemental is
lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the
conjurer and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil
will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An uncontrolled
elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own;
such creatures will never choose to remain on the Material Plane for
long.</p>
