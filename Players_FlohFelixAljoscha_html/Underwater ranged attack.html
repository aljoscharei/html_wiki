<h1 >Underwater ranged attack</h1>
<p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target
beyond the weaponâ€™s normal range. Even against a target within normal
range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow,
a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear,
trident, or dart).</p>
