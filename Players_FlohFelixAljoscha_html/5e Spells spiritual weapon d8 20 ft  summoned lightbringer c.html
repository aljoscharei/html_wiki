<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for
the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the
spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5
feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8
+ your spellcasting ability modifier.<br />
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet
and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.<br />
The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are
associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his
mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every
two slot levels above 2nd.</p>
