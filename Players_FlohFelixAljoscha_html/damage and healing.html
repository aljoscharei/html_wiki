<p>description: Rules for tracking damage, death and healing from the
5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >Damage and Healing</h1>
<p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who
explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed
arrow, or a blast of flame from a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong>
spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of
creatures.</p>
<h2 >Hit Points</h2>
<p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability,
the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more
difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>
<p>A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can
be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This
number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives
healing.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its
hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s
capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<h2 >Damage Rolls</h2>
<p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage
it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply
the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other
factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to
deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p>
<p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, <strong>you add your
ability modifier–the same modifier used for the attack roll–to the
damage.</strong> A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll
for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p>
<p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one
target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.
For example, when a wizard casts <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> or a
cleric casts <strong><em>flame strike</em></strong>, the spell’s damage
is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p>

<h3 >Damage Types</h3>
<p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal
different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but
other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p>
<p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage
type to a new effect.</p>

<h2 >Damage Resistance and
Vulnerability</h2>
<p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually
easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>
<p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a
damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or
an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of
that type is doubled against it.</p>
<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other
modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to
bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning
damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all
damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the
creature takes 10 damage.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the
same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature
has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical
damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the
creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>
<h2 >Healing</h2>
<p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is
reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit
points, and magical methods such as a <strong><em>cure
wounds</em></strong> spell or a <strong>potion of healing</strong> can
remove damage in an instant.</p>
<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are
added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed
its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this
number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not
8.</p>
<p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as
the <strong><em>revivify</em></strong> spell has restored it to
life.</p>

<h2 >Knocking a Creature Out</h2>
<p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a
killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can
make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
unconscious and is stable.</p>
<h2 >Temporary Hit Points</h2>
<p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a
creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a
buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
injury.</p>
<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit
points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your
normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and
take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2
damage.</p>
<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit
points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can,
therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>
<p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added
together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you
decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For
example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already
have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>
<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t
restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb
damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing
can save you.</p>
<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration,
they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>
