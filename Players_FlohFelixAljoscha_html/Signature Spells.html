<h1 >Signature Spells</h1>
<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells
and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level or lower
spells that you know. You can cast them at their base level without
gaining any Corruption. If you cast them as a higher level, you gain
Corruption as normal</p>
