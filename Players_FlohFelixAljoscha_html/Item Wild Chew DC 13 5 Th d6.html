<h1 >Item Wild Chew DC 13 5 Th d6</h1>
<p>This is a strong stimulant, making the chew- er more spirited, less
careful and very aggressive. One dose of wild chew adds Reckless. The
creature has ad- vantage on its attacks and attackers have advantage on
their attacks against the creature. The effect lasts one hour, after
which the creature gains a level of exhaus- tion. Over time wild chew
becomes very addictive and severe withdrawal symptoms will occur unless
the user consumes at least one dose each week, with the risk of
permanent madness or death. No known drugs can counteract this.</p>
