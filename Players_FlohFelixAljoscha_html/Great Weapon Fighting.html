<h1 >Great Weapon Fighting</h1>
<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The
weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
this benefit.</p>
