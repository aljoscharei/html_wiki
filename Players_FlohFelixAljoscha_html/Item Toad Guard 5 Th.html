<h1 >Item Toad Guard 5 Th</h1>
<p>A figurine in the form of a toad acts as an alarm. The user – who has
to know at least one spell – whispers a triggering condition to the
figurine; the trigger has to be of a physical nature and must occur
close to the toad guard, for example that “someone passes through the
grove” or “the door is opened from outside.” If activated, the toad will
wake everyone with a loud croaking.</p>
