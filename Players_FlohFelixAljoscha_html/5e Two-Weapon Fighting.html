<h1 >5e Two-Weapon Fighting</h1>
<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon
that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack
with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other
hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus
attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,
instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>

melee weapon that in the other hand. Ability modifers are not added to

making a melee attack.</p>
