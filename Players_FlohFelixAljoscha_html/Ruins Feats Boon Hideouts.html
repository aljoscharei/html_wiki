<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Hideouts</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Intelligence<br />
Many organizations and networks regularly establish hide- outs in Ambria
and the outer regions of Davokar; guilds and factions like witches, the
Queen’s Rangers and most barbar- ian clans maintain such places for
their members. The char- acter knows of, and has access to, a series of
such hideouts, linked to a specific group. There they can lay low and
replace or repair vital equipment, including weapons and armor.</p>
<p>When you need to find a hideout, make a DC 15 Intelli- gence check –
a success means that you recall the location of a place in the vicinity.
The location is hidden, safe and contains equipment to a value of 10
thaler; the character de- cides what is kept in the hideout, items
and/or coins. If you take something from a hideout, you’re expected to
replace it later, or at least report what was taken and for what
purpose.</p>
