<h1 >5e Falling</h1>
<p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing
an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>
<p>In a stable, belly to earth position, terminal velocity of the human
body is about <strong>200 km/h (about 120 mph)</strong>. A stable,
freefly, head down position has a terminal speed of around 240-290 km/h
(around 150-180 mph).</p>
<h3 >Rate of Falling</h3>
<p>https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/dungeon-masters-tools#RateofFalling
The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the
entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high
altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a griffon or on board an
airship? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a
few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred.
If you’d like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the
following optional rule.</p>
<p>When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to
<strong>500</strong> feet. If you’re still falling on your next turn,
you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process
continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the
fall is otherwise halted.</p>
<h3 >Flying Creatures and Falling</h3>
<p>https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/dungeon-masters-tools#FlyingCreaturesandFalling</p>
<p>A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked <a
href="Prone.html">Prone</a>, if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it
otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being
held aloft by magic, such as the <a
href="5e%20spells%20fly%2010%20mins%20w%20not%20favoured.html">5e spells
fly 10 mins w not favoured</a> spell.</p>
<p>If you’d like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving
a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the
creature’s current flying speed from the distance it fell before
calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is
knocked <a href="Prone.html">Prone</a> but is still conscious and has a
current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed
to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar
measures to slow the velocity of its fall.</p>
<p>If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a
flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as
other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns
still falling and is <a href="prone.html">Prone</a>, it can halt the fall
on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the <a
href="prone.html">Prone</a> condition (as if it were standing up in
midair).</p>
<h1 >IRL</h1>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity Based on air
resistance, for example, the terminal speed of a skydiver in a
belly-to-earth (i.e., face down) free fall position is about
<strong>55 m/s = 180 ft/s = 200 km/h</strong> This speed is the
asymptotic limiting value of the speed, and the forces acting on the
body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal speed is
approached. In this example, a speed of 50% of terminal speed is reached
after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15
seconds to reach 99% and so on.</p>
<p>This means it is roughly 1000 ft./6s</p>
