<h1 >Charisma</h1>
<p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others.
It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can
represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>
<h2 >Charisma Checks</h2>
<p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or
when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,
Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>
