<h1 >5e Order of Combat Bonus
Actions</h1>
<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an
additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action
feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can
take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.</p>
<p>You can take <strong>only one bonus action on your turn</strong>, so
you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one
available. ^5349a3</p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the
bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of
your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus
action.</p>
