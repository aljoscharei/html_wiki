<h1 >Hallucinatory Terrain</h1>
<p><em>4th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of
green plant)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and
smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a
road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a
grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully
like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and
creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.<br />
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures
entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the
difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the
illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for
what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain. <a

The caster creates a 1 hex illusionary terrain piece of the caster’s
choice. It may be placed up to 12 hexes away from the caster. The spell
lasts until the hallucinatory terrain is touched by a unit or until
dispelled. This spell can be cast before battle during set-up, provided
the caster’s army was not surprised.</p>

<p>This spell makes an area of outdoor terrain appear as a different
type (e.g. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). The
entire terrain feature must be within range of the spell. This spell
requires a full turn to cast.</p>
<p>The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of
natural terrain. A save versus Spells is allowed to see through the
illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively
attempt to do so. The spell lasts until the illusion is touched by an
intelligent creature moving into the hallucinatory terrain.</p>
