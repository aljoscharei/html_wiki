<p>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell
ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a
harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This
spell doesnâ€™t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
explosion of a fireball.<br />
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an
enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>
