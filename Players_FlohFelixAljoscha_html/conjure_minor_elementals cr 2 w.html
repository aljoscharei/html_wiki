<h1 >Conjure Minor Elementals</h1>
<p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can
see within range. You choose one the following options for what
appears:</p>
<ul>
<li>One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
<li>Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
<li>Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
<li>Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower.</li>
</ul>
<p>An elemental summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit
points or when the spell ends.<br />
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.<br />
The GM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using
certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning
options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level
slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.</p>
