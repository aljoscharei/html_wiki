<h1 >Heavy Armor</h1>
<p>Heavy armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly,
stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in
the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s
speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or
higher than the listed score.</p>
<p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.
These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a
wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight
and bulk.</p>
<p>Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor
Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is
negative.</p>
