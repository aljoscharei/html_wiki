<h1 >Weapon Properties 5e
Ammunition</h1>
<p>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a
ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each
time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition.
Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part
of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).
<strong>At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended
ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</strong></p>
<p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee
attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised
Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any
damage when used in this way.</p>
