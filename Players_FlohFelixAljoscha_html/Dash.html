<h1 >Dash</h1>
<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the
current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any
modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60
feet on your turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed
changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30
feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet
this turn if you dash.</p>
<p>That means you can take dash as the bonus action and also take dash
as the action, so a rougue with <a href="Cunning%20action.html">Cunning
action</a> or a Goblin with <a
href="Orignin%20Trait%20Survival%20Instinct.html">Orignin Trait Survival
Instinct</a> can doublbe dash.</p>

dash If you have a feature like Cunning Action or Step of the Wind, can
you take the Dash action more than once on your turn?</h4>
<p>If you can take the <a href="Dash.html">Dash</a> action as a bonus
action, nothing in the rules prevents you from taking the <a
href="Dash.html">Dash</a> action with your regular action too. The same
principle holds when you use a feature like <a
href="Action%20Surge.html">Action Surge</a> ; you could use both of your
actions to take the <a href="Dash.html">Dash</a> action.</p>
