<h1 >Calm Emotions</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each
humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose
within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to
fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving
throw, choose one of the following two effects.<br />
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be <a
href="202202102000%205e%20Conditions%20Charmed.html">202202102000 5e
Conditions Charmed</a> or <a href="5e%20Conditions%20Frightened.html">5e
Conditions Frightened</a>. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect
resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make a target “indifferent about creatures of
your choice” that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the
target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its
friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile
again, unless the GM rules otherwise.</p>
