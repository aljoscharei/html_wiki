<h1 >Ruins of
Symbaroum Captain Approach Poet Warrior</h1>
<p>You became a captain not because you love war, or hate oppression, or
even wish to profit from your own safety. But instead you are a true
philosopher of war, one that observes and then acts with efficiency for
its own sake. Your weapon becomes like your pen, a teacher in deeds, not
words. And those that survive your lessons would do well to think on
them.</p>
