<p>As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch
to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature
moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed
doesnâ€™t need to make the save.</p>
