<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of
water)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall
cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within
range. The area is <a href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e heavily
obscured</a>, and exposed flames in the area are doused.<br />
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it <a
href="5e%20Difficult%20Terrain.html">5e Difficult Terrain</a>. When a
creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
it falls <a href="prone.html">Prone</a>.<br />
If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must
make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC
or lose concentration.</p>
