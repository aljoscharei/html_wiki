<h1 >5e Items Holy Symbol</h1>
<p>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be
an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol
carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box
holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy
symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the
caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a
shield.</p>
