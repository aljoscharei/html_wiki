<h1 >Ruins Feats Boon Enterprise</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +1 to Intelligence or Charisma<br />
You own some kind of establishment – a small tavern, a smaller store or
some other simple craft service like a cobbler or trinket shop. Other
alternatives are a theater or a troupe of acrobats. The enterprise can
be stationary in a place often visited by the characters between
adventures, or it can be mobile in the form of a wagon or a river boat
if that feels more reasonable.</p>
<p>During an extended rest, you may make a DC 15 Intelligence or
Charisma check. A success renders a profit of 10+1d10 thaler, after all
expenses have been paid. This goes into the enterprises’ reserves. A
failure indicates a loss of thaler equal to the roll. If the business
does not have any reserves to pay what it owes, it may operate until the
next extended rest. If it fails again, the enterprise cannot try again
until you spend some downtime on site, correcting any issues. If more
than one character has Enterprise, they can be part of the same
establishment or business. If so, both characters roll a profit check
each. Characters that visit the enterprise can withdraw money from the
business’s reserves, or add to the reserves from their own funds.</p>
