<h1 >Arcane Hand</h1>
<p>5th-level evocation</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin
glove)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an
unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the
spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements
of your own hand.<br />
The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit
point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a
Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill
its space.<br />
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns,
you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following
effects with it.<br />
<strong>Clenched Fist.</strong> The hand strikes one creature or object
within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your
game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.<br />
<strong>Forceful Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to push a creature
within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the
hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the
target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the
check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a
number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier.
The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.<br />
<strong>Grasping Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or
smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score
to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have
advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can
use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target
takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier.<br />
<strong>Interposing Hand.</strong> The hand interposes itself between
you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different
command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing
you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the
hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s
Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space,
but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist
option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases
by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

of the following effects with it:<br />
• Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object</p>
<p>within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using
your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p>
<p>• Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet

cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space
if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength
score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score,
the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space
counts as diffi- cult terrain for the target.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher,
the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8, the damage
from the grasping hand increases by 2d6, the Strength for the forceful
hand increases by 2 for each level above 5th.</p>
