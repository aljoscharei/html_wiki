<h1 >Chapter 4: Personality and
Background</h1>
<p>Characters are defined by much more than their race and class.
They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and
capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter
expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another,
including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of
backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and
alignment.</p>

<h2 >Character Details</h2>
<p>Your character’s name and physical description might be the first
things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth
thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have
in mind.</p>
<p>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CONTRASTING CHARACTERS</p>
<p>The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your
character apart from every other character. Consider the following two
human fighters.</p>
<p>Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash
teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran
away from home and practiced her father’s trade on the streets of
Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last
Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a
barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace and
destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the
friends she’d known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying
pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on
the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.</p>
<p>Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten
Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own
territory in one of the city’s hundreds of poor shanty towns. After
several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful
thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild
quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of
the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some
stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself
to improve his skills.</p>
<p>Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some
experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity
scores, but there the similarity ends.</p>
<h3 >Name</h3>
<p>Your character’s race description includes sample names for members
of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just
picking one from a list.</p>
<p>###Sex</p>
<p>You choose your character’s sex, gender, and sexual orientation.
Think about how your character interacts with the broader culture’s
expectations about these characteristics. For example, many genderfluid
worshipers of Corellon see themselves as embodying their deity’s
transcendence of sex and gender, and some elves’ connection to that
deity allows them to change their sex.</p>
<h3 >Height and Weight</h3>
<p>You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the
information provided in your race description or on the Random Height
and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might
say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might
be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p>
<p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and
weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in
the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in
inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice
roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the
character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.</p>

<p>For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus
2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika
stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12
and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an
extra 36 pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of
146 pounds.</p>
<h3 >Other Physical
Characteristics</h3>
<p>You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair,
eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to
give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic,
such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.</p>
<p>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CHARACTER DETAILS</p>
<p>Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set these
characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Tika
is a young woman determined to prove that she’s not just a kid any more,
and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri,
however, carries a more mysterious name.</p>
<p>Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and
has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her
right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has
angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a
shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and
lifeless — betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.</p>
<h3 ><a href="Alignment.html">alignment</a></h3>
<p>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT</p>
<p>Tika Waylan is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Alignment">neutral
good</a>, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where
she can. Artemis is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Alignment">lawful
evil</a>, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least
professional in his approach to murder.</p>
<p>As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began
his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must —
and when it’s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers
cause problems in groups alongside others who don’t share their
interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains
and monsters.</p>

<h3 >Personal Characteristics</h3>
<p>Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits,
mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique
identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game.
Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about
your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures,
vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.</p>
<p>Each background presented in this chapter includes suggested
characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not
bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>
<h4 >Personality Traits</h4>
<p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are
small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other
character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting
and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are
specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a
good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every
book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s
interests and disposition.</p>
<p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes,
his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or
fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of
his or her ability scores.</p>
<p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look
at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related
to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard
to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high
score.</p>

<p>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan
dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad
fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared
for the worst and moves with a quick, precise confidence.</p>
<p>Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike,
believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating
everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and
respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he
constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil
alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.</p>
<p>Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn’s
proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her
adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its
destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal
reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as
“I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the
destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.”</p>
<p>Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship
with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In
his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in
his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, he
might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment,
Artemis is more than a criminal assassin — he is an antihero, driven by
his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as “I will not rest
until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.”</p>
<p>Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is
naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and
annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago. She
might even be tempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced
that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis
Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relationship and just
wants to be left alone.</p>
