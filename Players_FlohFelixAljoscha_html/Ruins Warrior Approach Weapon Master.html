Weapon Master</h1>
<p>You have dedicated yourself to the mastery of a single weapon. Among
the warriors of Ambria and Davokar there are those who have committed
themselves to becoming true masters of a specific weapon. Through
persistent training, these Weapon Masters have become very skilled with
their weapon of choice, and often adhere to a philosophy about the
struggle between life and death.</p>
<p>They are known as Sword Saints in Ambria, devoted to perfecting their
skill with the chosen weapon. Among barbarians there are the Axe
Artists, often wielding one axe in each hand â€“ a tradition also adopted
by some of the goblin tribes of Davokar. The elven equivalent to a
weapon master is called a Spear Dancer, an art form also practiced by
abducted humans. Among trolls, chain weapons are considered extra noble,
both very demanding and very effective in the right hands. Such
Flailers, in the form of ogres, can often be found in the gladiatorial
arenas of Ambria.</p>
