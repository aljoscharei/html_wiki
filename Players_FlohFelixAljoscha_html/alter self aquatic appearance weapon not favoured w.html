<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of
the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the
spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to
gain the benefits of a different one.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatic Adaptation.</strong> You adapt your body to an
aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your
fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to
your walking speed.</p>
<p><strong>Change Appearance.</strong> You transform your appearance.
You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial
features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and
distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as
a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You
also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your
basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell
to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the
spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way
again. <a href="5e%20spells%20disguise%20self%20%20%20w.html">5e spells

<p><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed
strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as
appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with
your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have
a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>
