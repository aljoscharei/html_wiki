<h1 >Ogre Background Sellsword</h1>
<p>You were pressed into service as a warrior almost as soon as you were
discovered. The people who found you might have had good intentions and
you might have defended a village or patrolled a patch of roadway. But
more likely the folks you fell in with were robbers and thieves and you
were taught that might made right, and your might helped make them right
more often than not.</p>

<p>Feature: <a href="Routine%20Punishment.html">Routine Punishment</a>
Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>You haven’t known any other life than that of a mercenary. You might
feel that you have done nothing but good with your weapons, but there’s
still some hint in the back of your mind that you were meant for
something more than just killing people (even if you are really good at
it).</p>
<p>Personality 1. Everyone underestimates me because I’m slow to talk.
But I want to be sure I say what I mean. 2. I give one warning, and only
one. 3. I know people expect me to be slow so I overcompensate to come
off as clever. 4. I plan meticulously for the next fight. That’s how I
was taught to do it. 5. I stand too close to people on purpose; it makes
them more inclined to agree with me. 6. I play dumb to lull my enemies
into thinking this will be an easy fight. 7. I love to talk, sing and
drink. 8. I am always ready, and it shows in where I stand, sit, sleep
and how I move. No one will have one up on me, ever.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Duty. The best thing I can do is my job. It’s why I’m here.
2. Might. I am the biggest and the strongest, I get first choice. 3.
Companionship. The winner of the fight is the one with the most friends.
4. Fairness. I protect the little people because I am big. 5.
Pragmatism. I will fight for the one who pays best; allegiance is just
another word for paycheck. 6. Fatalism. No reason to worry about
outcomes, we plan and the gods laugh.</p>
<p>Bond 1. The warrior that took care of me was harsh but fair, she
taught me all I needed to live this life. 2. I have found my leader and
will follow that person till the end. 3. I was left for dead by earlier
“companions,” this they will regret. 4. It’s all about the friends next
to me, it’s as simple as that. 5. My first job was for someone I really
admire. I still carry a piece of the battle standard we flew around my
arm. 6. There is this goblin that annoys the hell out of me, and I
cannot imagine not having the creature around.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I don’t know any other ways of solving problems except by
violence. 2. I hate fighting small enemies, it’s embarrassing when they
hurt me. 3. I become all giggly and silly when drinking, it’s just very
un-ogre-like. 4. I am freaked out by enemies as big as or bigger than
me; it takes away my only advantage. 5. I once deserted a unit I was in.
They won the fight anyway. 6. I follow orders blindly, I know no other
way.</p>
