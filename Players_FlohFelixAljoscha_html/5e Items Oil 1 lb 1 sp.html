<h1 >5e Items Oil 1 lb 1 sp</h1>
<p>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action,
you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of
you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged
attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an
improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target
takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target
takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also
pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area,
provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds
and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its
turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per
turn.</p>
