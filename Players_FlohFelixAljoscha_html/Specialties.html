<h1 >Specialties</h1>
<p>When you reach 6th level, choose one of the following
specialties.</p>
<p>Marksman</p>
<p>Marksmen have their natural position in every army, scout- ing party
and band of brigands. You can inflict serious dam- age on enemies with a
bow or crossbow, hoping to either bring them down or at least make sure
that they do not reach your allies who are equipped only for melee
combat.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of your turn you can use your bonus action to aim. Your
speed becomes 0 and you now have advantage on ranged weapon
attacks.</li>
<li>At 9th level you score a critical hit on ranged weapon attacks with
a natural roll of 19 or 20 on the die.</li>
<li>At 13th level you no longer suffer disadvantage for being at long
range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monster Lore</p>
<p>The character is schooled in the lore of beasts and knows the secrets
of most monsters. Many monsters possess special abilities and unique
attacks as well as weaknesses which are good to know about when trying
to bring them down. • Make an Intelligence (Nature) check with the DC
equal to 10 plus the challenge rating (rounding down for fractional
ratings) of any beast, giant, humanoid or plant. On a success, the GM
must inform you of any vulnerabilities, resistances or immunities the
creature possesses and provide you with a general assessment of its
threat to the party (‘minimal’, ’average’, or ’severe’).</p>
<ul>
<li>At 9th level, you can also make the same assessment of dragons,
elementals, fey and monstrosities.</li>
<li>At 13th level you can make the same assessment for abom- inations,
constructs, oozes and undead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixth Sense</p>
<p>When moving through dark forests or mountain tunnels, one’s eyes are
no longer very useful. Lighting a lantern or torch may attract dangers,
so the explorer had better learn to rely on their other senses. With
dedicated training it is possible to awaken these other senses and
sharpen them to the brink of eeriness.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. Incomplete
darkness, you rely on your other senses to give you blindsight within 30
feet. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due
to darkness.</li>
<li>At 9th level, you are always aware of your environment and cannot be
surprised.</li>
<li>At 13th level, your blindsight increases to a 90-footrange.</li>
</ul>
