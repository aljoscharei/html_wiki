<h1 >Wall of Stone</h1>
<p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small block of granite)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point
you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of
ten 10-foot- by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at
least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot
panels that are only 3 inches thick.<br />
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature
would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another
solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is
no longer enclosed by the wall.<br />
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same
space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or
rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
chasm or create a ramp.<br />
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the
size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to
create crenellations, battlements, and so on.<br />
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus
breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected
panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.</p>
<p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole
duration, the wall becomes <strong>permanent</strong> and can’t be
dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>

This spell creates an opaque wall of stone 2 hexes long anywhere within
3 hexes of the caster. The wall blocks line of sight normally. It lasts
until destroyed or dispelled. This spell can be cast before battle,
during set-up, provided the caster’s army was not surprised. See Chapter
2, Terrain (p. 33), and Chapter 5, Assaults (p. 53) for details on
walls.</p>

Range: | 60’ | :——– | :———— | Arcane | 5 | Duration: | permanent</p>
<p>The caster brings a stone wall into being that can be any form the
caster desires, to a maximum of 1,000 cubic feet. This wall is permanent
unless otherwise destroyed or dispelled with dispel magic. The wall may
not be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are,
and it must rest on a solid surface.</p>
<p>The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he desires.
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm
foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by
existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a
ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20’, the wall must be
arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by
half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations,
battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p>
