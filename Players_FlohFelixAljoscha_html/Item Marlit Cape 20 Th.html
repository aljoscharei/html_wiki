<h1 >Item Marlit Cape 20 Th</h1>
<p>The skin of a marlit, a reptile known for its sneaky hunting style,
is treated with preserving alchemi- cal preparations so that it keeps
its camouflaging proper- ties after the death of the beast. The wearer
has advantage on one Dexterity (Stealth) check, and must take a long or
extended rest before using this benefit of the cape again.</p>
