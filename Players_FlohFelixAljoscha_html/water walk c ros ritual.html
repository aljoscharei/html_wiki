Theurg Spells</a> # Water Walk <em>3rd-level transmutation
(ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of cork)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface–such
as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava–as if it were harmless
solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from
the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain
this ability for the duration.<br />
If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the
target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.</p>
