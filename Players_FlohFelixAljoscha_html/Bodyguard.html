<h1 >Bodyguard</h1>
<p>You are trained to put yourself between those you escort and any
danger. You can use your reaction to take a blow meant for another
creature within 5 feet of you. You must be within 5 feet of the
attacker. The attack roll against the original target is compared to
your armor class and you take damage only if it would strike you. At
sixth level, when you use your reaction for this feature you may also
make a single attack roll against the attacking creature if you are
wielding a weapon capable of hitting it.</p>
