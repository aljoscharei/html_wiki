<h1 >Item Twilight Tincture DC
17 60 Th 1</h1>
<p>This is an extract of dried stems and leaves from the extremely rare
Twilight Thistle. Up until recently the rareness of the herb (on
occasion, one or a couple of stems can be found among other offerings in
the ruins of Davokar, rather than an actual growing site) coupled with
its moderate medical effect made it not very sought-after; it seems to
have an effect on certain types of eczema and possibly also on senility
if consumed. However, with the aging of the queen mother has come an
increased demand from the court. Of course, the tale of how Lasifor
Nightpitch bought the land on which Thistle Hold is built for an armful
of Twilight Thistles gave the herb a hefty boost in popularity among
fortune hunters. Lately, the twilight tincture has found another group
of users, and a new area of use: it has proven capable of disguising a
number of symptoms gained from being undead. Desperate unfortunates –
some of them alche- mists – searched for ways to hide their death marks,
and someone discovered that the twilight tincture (consumed, not smeared
on the skin) temporarily made an undead body come to life: the skin
regained its redness, the body temperature rose, and the smell of the
breath improved dramatically. The effect lasts for a week and then the
undead crea- ture must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the
save fails, the effect lingers for one more day before dissipating
completely. On thoroughly corrupt creatures the effect only lasts for a
day per dose, no saving throw is made.</p>
