<h1 >Blade Work</h1>
<p>If you are wielding only knives or daggers, add your ability modifier
to damage with your off-hand weapon. At 6th level, you are an expert at
close-in fighting. If you’re wielding knives or daggers in both hands
and your opponent has longer weapons they have disadvantage on their
attack rolls against you. Natural weapons don’t trigger this
feature.</p>
