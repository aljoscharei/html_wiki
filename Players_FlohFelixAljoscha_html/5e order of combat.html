<p>description: Rules for the order of combat and possible actions from
the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >The Order of Combat</h1>
<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of
weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game
organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong><a href="combat%20round.html">combat round</a></strong>
represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each
participant in a battle takes a <strong><a
href="combat%20turn.html">combat turn</a></strong>. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls
initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side has defeated the other. ^25c83c</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Combat Step by Step</h3>
<p><strong>1. Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether
anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</p>
<p><strong>2. Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the
characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching
order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM
figures out where the adversaries are–how far away and in what
direction.</p>
<p><strong>3. Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’
turns.</p>
<p><strong>4. Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes
a turn in initiative order.</p>
<p><strong>5. Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in
the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the
fighting stops.</p>
<h2 ><a href="5e%20Surprise.html">5e Surprise</a></h2>
<h2 >Initiative</h2>
<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their
place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group
of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
time.</p>
<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest
Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order
(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The
initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled
creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.
The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters
each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>
<h2 >Your Turn</h2>
<p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your
speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. You decide whether to move
first or take your action first. Your speed–sometimes called your
walking speed–is noted on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the “<a
href="actions%20in%20combat.html">actions in combat</a>” section later in
this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional
options for your action.</p>
<p>The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the
rules for your move. <a href="movement%20and%20position.html">movement and
position</a></p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking
the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”</p>

<h3 >Other Activity on Your Turn</h3>
<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither
your action nor your move.</p>
<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances
and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
<p><a href="5e%20interacting%20with%20objects.html">5e interacting with
objects</a> You can also interact with one object or feature of the
environment for free, during either your move or your action. For
example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a
foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to
attack.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your
action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an
action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities
when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>
