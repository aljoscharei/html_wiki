<p>When cast before battle, bless gives the caster and his allies
(within a 50’ radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 to attack throws,
damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the
caster), and saving throws against magical fear. It may not be cast on
creatures who are already engaged in melee.</p>
<p>Divine spellcasters of 7th level or higher may also use bless to
create holy water. One casting of bless will transform 1 pint of
ordinary water into holy water. Casting bless in this manner demands a
sacrifice to the caster’s deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy
water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the
vial it was blessed in. See the <a
href="ACKS%20Chapter%2003%20Equipment.md#equipment-descriptions">Equipment
Descriptions</a> in Chapter 3 for information on holy water.</p>
<p>The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster’s enemies
(within a 50’ radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected
character or monster to suffer a -1 penalty on attack throws, damage
rolls, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear. Bane may
also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in
conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of
unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the
animation of the dead. See Animate Dead, above.</p>
<p><a href="OSE%20Bless">OSE Bless</a> # Bless (Blight)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 turns</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60’</p>
<p>May be used in one of two situations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Battle:</strong> Allies within a 20’ square area who are not
yet in melee gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 bonus
to morale.</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> Casting <em>bless</em> may also form part
of rituals of purification or consecration, at the referee’s
discretion.</li>
</ol>
<h2 >Reversed: Blight</h2>
<p>Incurs a –1 penalty to morale checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls
of enemies within a 20’ square area. A <strong>save versus
spells</strong> is allowed to resist the <em>blight</em>.</p>
<p><a
href="202208070936%20ACKS%20Domains%20at%20War%20Battles#Bless"></a>
This spell affects one unit within 2 hexes of the caster. The target
unit must not already be in melee. The unit gains +1 on attack throws.
Its morale score is increased by 1. The bless lasts the duration of the
battle or until dispelled. The reverse of this spell, blight, affects
one enemy unit unless a Save versus Spells is made. A blighted unit
suffers -1 on its attack throws and has its morale score reduced by 1.
The reversed spell also lasts the duration of the battle or until
dispelled.</p>
