<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent
moss)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you
like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the
light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an
action.<br />
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that
creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the
spell.</p>

<p>This spell targets one unit within 6 hexes of the caster. If the unit
has penalties when fighting in bright light, it suffers these penalties
when affected by the spell, unless the unit makes a Save v. Spells. The
spell lasts the duration of the battle or until dispelled.</p>

<p>This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full
daylight up to a 30’ radius, and with lesser intensity to a radius of
60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a
creature, just as with the light spell, up to a maximum range of 360’
from the caster.</p>
<p>As with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on
its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save
versus Death; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just
behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded
creature’s attack throws if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p>The reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of
light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources.
Continual darkness may be used to blind just as continual light can. Any
blindness ends when the spell ends.</p>
<p>Continual light and continual darkness are not permanent effects, but
are instead effects that are indefinitely sustained by the caster
without need for concentration. A caster may indefinitely sustain one
continual light or continual darkness spell per level of experience. A
truly permanent light requires a permanency ritual.</p>
