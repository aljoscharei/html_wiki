You can speak to creatures from the monster category Beasts. Beasts have
their limitations but can answer questions about which creatures are in,
or have traveled through, an area, and also estimate their numbers (one,
two or many). The beasts do not perform any services; they talk to you
as equals. <a href="5e%20monsters%20by%20type">5e monsters by
