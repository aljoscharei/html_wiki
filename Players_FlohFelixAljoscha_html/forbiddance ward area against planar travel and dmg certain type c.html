<p><em>6th-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare
incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 day</p>
<p>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000
square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For
the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals,
such as those created by the <strong><em><a
href="gate%20planar%20travel%20wc%20not%20favoured">gate planar travel
wc not favoured</a></em></strong> spell, to enter the area. The spell
proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures
from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane,
Feywild, Shadowfell, or the <strong><em><a
href="plane%20shift%208%20friends%20also%20banish%20wc.html">plane shift 8
friends also banish wc</a></em></strong> spell.<br />
In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when
you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the
spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the
creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you
cast this spell).<br />
When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that
speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the
spell.<br />
The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another
<strong><em>forbiddance</em></strong> spell. If you cast
<strong><em>forbiddance</em></strong> every day for 30 days in the same
location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material
components are consumed on the last casting.</p>
