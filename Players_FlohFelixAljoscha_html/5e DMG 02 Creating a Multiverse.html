<h1 >5e DMG 02 Creating a
Multiverse</h1>
<h2 >Chapter 2: Creating a
Multiverse</h2>
<p>When adventurers reach higher levels, their path extends to other
dimensions of reality: the planes of existence that form the multiverse.
The characters might be called on to rescue a friend from the horrific
depths of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of the River Oceanus.
They can hoist a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard or face the
chaos of Limbo to contact a wizened githzerai sage.</p>
<p>Planes of existence define the extremes of strange and often
dangerous environments. The most bizarre locations present settings
undreamed of in the natural world. Planar adventures offer unprecedented
dangers and wonders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid fire, or
test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.</p>

<h2 >The Planes</h2>
<p>The various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery.
They’re not simply other worlds, but dimensions formed and governed by
spiritual and elemental principles.</p>
<p>The Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and thought. They are the
spheres where celestials, fiends, and deities exist. The plane of
Elysium, for example, isn’t merely a place where good creatures dwell,
and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when
they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil
can’t flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a
physical location.</p>
<p>The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature
of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental Plane of Fire, for
example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane’s entire substance is
suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion,
transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt
seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the
vibrancy of fire’s dominion.</p>
<p>In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these
philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&amp;D exist within the Material
Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures.
The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material
Plane.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlanarCategories"></a>Planar
Categories</h3>
<p>The planes of the default D&amp;D cosmology are grouped in the
following categories:</p>
<p><strong>The Material Plane and Its Echoes.</strong> The Feywild and
the Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane.</p>
<p><strong>The Transitive Planes.</strong> The Ethereal Plane and the
Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as
pathways to travel from one plane to another.</p>
<p><strong>The Inner Planes.</strong> The four Elemental Planes (Air,
Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them,
are the Inner Planes.</p>
<p><strong>The Outer Planes.</strong> Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to
the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference
between them.</p>
<p><strong>The Positive and Negative Planes.</strong> These two planes
enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and
death that underlie the rest of existence in the multiverse.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PuttingthePlanesTogether"></a>Putting
the Planes Together</h3>
<p>As described in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>, the
assumed D&amp;D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For your
campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the standard
planes, drawn from Earth’s myths, or created by your own
imagination.</p>
<p>At minimum, most D&amp;D campaigns require these elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plane of origin for fiends</li>
<li>A plane of origin for celestials</li>
<li>A plane of origin for elementals</li>
<li>A place for deities, which might include any or all of the previous
three</li>
<li>The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include
any or all of the first three</li>
<li>A way of getting from one plane to another</li>
<li>A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the
Ethereal Plane to function</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign,
putting them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the
primary way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive
Planes, is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact
relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical
concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in
their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No
mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia
and Arcadia, but it’s a convenient theoretical construct based on the
philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance
they give to law and good.</p>
<p>Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models to make sense of
the jumble of planes, particularly the Outer Planes. The three most
common are the Great Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you
can create or adapt whatever model works best for the planes you want to
use in your game.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheGreatWheel"></a>The
Great Wheel</h4>
<p>The default cosmological arrangement presented in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>
visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material
Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel around
the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer
Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) that
one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking them
all.</p>
<p>This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx flows among
the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades,
Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it’s not
the only possible explanation of the river’s course.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheWorldTree"></a>The
World Tree</h4>
<p>A different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the
roots and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or
figuratively.</p>
<p>For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil.
The three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an
Outer Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other
regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld).
The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that
connects Asgard and Midgard.</p>
<p>Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities of the
Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial planes in the
branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are linked by a
River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these
planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though they are
also the homes of celestial and fiendish creatures.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheWorldAxis"></a>The
World Axis</h4>
<p>In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand
between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats
above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes).
Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single,
undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together.
At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in
the fabric of the cosmos.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OtherVisions"></a>Other
Visions</h4>
<p>As you build your own cosmology, consider the following
alternatives.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Omniverse.</em></strong> This simple cosmology covers
the bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; a single
Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-aligned deities and
celestials live; and the Underworld, where evil deities and fiends
live.</p>
<p><strong><em>Myriad Planes.</em></strong> In this cosmology, countless
planes clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each other
more or less at random.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Orrery.</em></strong> All the Inner and Outer Planes
orbit the Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on the
world as they come nearer and farther. The world of Eberron uses this
cosmological model.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Winding Road.</em></strong> In this cosmology, every
plane is a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to two
others, but there’s no necessary cohesion between adjacent planes; a
traveler can walk from the slopes of Mount Celestia onto the slopes of
Gehenna.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mount Olympus.</em></strong> In the Greek cosmology,
Mount Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material Plane),
with its peak so high that it’s actually another plane of existence:
Olympus, the home of the gods. All the Greek gods except Hades have
their own domains within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal
souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually fade into
nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned in endless darkness,
lies below Hades. And far to the west of the known world in the Material
Plane are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes reside
there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solar Barge.</em></strong> The Egyptian cosmology is
defined by the daily path of the sun — across the sky of the Material
Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, where the souls of
the righteous live in eternal reward, and then beneath the world through
the nightmarish Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer
Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral Plane and the
other Outer Planes in the different stages of its journey.</p>
<p><strong><em>One World.</em></strong> In this model, there are no
other planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes places like
the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount Celestia, the strange city of
Mechanus, the fortress of Acheron, and so on. All the planes are
locations in the world, reachable by ordinary means of travel — though
extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail across the sea to
the blessed isles of Elysium.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Otherworld.</em></strong> In this model, the Material
Plane has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. Much
like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane and can be reached
through “thin places” where the worlds are particularly close: through
caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote
forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods),
sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the blessed death),
and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is sometimes overseen by
an eternal city, or by four cities that each represent a different
aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called Tír na
nÓg, and the cosmologies of some religions inspired by Asian myth have a
similar Spirit World.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlanarTravel"></a>Planar
Travel</h2>
<p>When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, they undertake
a legendary journey that might force them to face supernatural guardians
and undergo various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials
along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and whether the
adventurers find a magic portal or use a spell to carry them.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlanarPortals"></a>Planar
Portals</h3>
<p>“Portal” is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection
that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on
another. Some portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear
window or a fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as
stepping through the doorway. Other portals are locations — circles of
standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns —
that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to
another. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very
similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane
of Water).</p>
<p>Passing through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel
from the Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of
the time, though, a portal presents an adventure in itself.</p>
<p>First, the adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want
to go. Most portals exist in distant locations, and a portal’s location
often has thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a
portal to the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a
mountain peak.</p>
<p>Second, portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that
undesirable people don’t pass through. Depending on the portal’s
destination, “undesirable people” might include evil characters, good
characters, cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal
creature. A portal’s guardian is typically a powerful magical creature,
such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal’s destination
plane.</p>
<p>Finally, most portals don’t stand open all the time, but open only in
particular situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can
have any conceivable requirement, but the following are the most
common:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/814/c2-02.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/814/325/431/c2-02.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Time.</strong> The portal functions only at particular times:
during a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the
stars are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains
open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon,
or for an hour, or for 1d4 + 1 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Situation.</strong> The portal functions only if a particular
condition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or
when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast in its vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Random.</strong> A random portal functions for a random
period, then shuts down for a similarly random duration. Typically, such
a portal allows 1d6 + 6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down for
1d6 days.</p>
<p><strong>Command Word.</strong> The portal functions only if a
particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the word must be spoken as
a character passes through the portal (which is otherwise a mundane
doorway, window, or similar opening). Other portals open when the
command word is spoken and remain open for a short time.</p>
<p><strong>Key.</strong> The portal functions if the traveler is holding
a particular object; the item acts much like a key to a door. This key
item can be a common object or a particular key created for that portal.
The city of Sigil above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors
because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keyed
portals.</p>
<p>Learning and meeting a portal’s requirements can draw characters into
further adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries
for command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit the
portal.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Spells"></a>Spells</h3>
<p>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of
existence. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">Plane
shift</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate">gate</a>
can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different
degrees of precision. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness">Etherealness</a>
allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection">astral
projection</a> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral
Plane and from there travel to the Outer Planes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Plane Shift.</em></strong> The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">plane shift</a>
spell has two important limitations. The first is the material
component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to
the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper resonating
frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork must be made
of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell’s
magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), but
even the act of researching the correct specifications can lead to
adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into the depths
of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is required to get
there.</p>
<p>Second, the spell doesn’t send the caster to a specific location
unless he or she has specialized information. The sigil sequence of a
teleportation circle located on another plane allows the caster to
travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge is even harder to
come by than the specifications of the required tuning fork. Otherwise,
the spell transports the caster to a location in the general vicinity of
the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, they’ll most likely
still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a planar
quest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gate.</em></strong> The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate">gate</a> spell opens a
portal linked to a specific point on another plane of existence. The
spell provides a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of the
guardians and trials that would normally fill such a journey. But this
9th-level spell is out of reach for all but the most powerful
characters, and it does nothing to negate any obstacles that wait at the
destination.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate">gate</a> spell is
powerful, but not infallible. A deity, demon lord, or other powerful
entity can prevent such a portal from opening within its dominion.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#AstralPlane"></a>Astral
Plane</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/815/c2-03.png"></a></p>
<p>The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors
travel as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great
silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and
gray streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the
Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon
the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting
forever in the silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools —
magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, spinning
coins.</p>
<p>Creatures on the Astral Plane don’t age or suffer from hunger or
thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live on the Astral Plane (such
as the githyanki) establish outposts on other planes, often the Material
Plane, so their children can grow to maturity.</p>
<p>A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about
moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature’s
walking speed (in feet) is equal to 3 × its Intelligence score. The
smarter a creature is, the easier it can control its movement by act of
will.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#AstralProjection"></a>Astral
Projection</h3>
<p>Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection">astral
projection</a> spell involves projecting one’s consciousness there,
usually in search of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the
Outer Planes are as much spiritual states of being as they are physical
places, this allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he
or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. A character’s
death — either in the Astral Plane or on the destination plane — causes
no actual harm. Only the severing of a character’s silver cord while on
the Astral Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body on
the Material Plane) can result in the character’s true death. Thus,
high-level characters sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection">astral
projection</a> rather than seek out a portal or use a more direct
spell.</p>
<p>Only a few things can sever a traveler’s silver cord, the most common
being a psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of
the githyanki also have this ability. A character who travels bodily to
the Astral Plane (by means of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">plane shift</a>
spell or one of the rare portals that leads directly there) has no
silver cord.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#ColorPools"></a>Color
Pools</h3>
<p>Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other planes appear as
two-dimensional pools of rippling colors, 1d6 × 10 feet in diameter.
Traveling to another plane requires locating a color pool that leads to
the desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be identified by
color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools table. Finding the right color
pool is a matter of chance: locating the correct one takes 1d4 × 10
hours of travel.</p>

<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PsychicWind"></a>Psychic
Wind</h3>
<p>A psychic wind isn’t a physical wind like that found on the Material
Plane, but a storm of thought that batters travelers’ minds rather than
their bodies. A psychic wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten
ideas, minor musings, and subconscious fears that went astray in the
Astral Plane and conglomerated into this powerful force.</p>
<p>A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of the
silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes as dark as a
moonless night. As the sky darkens, the traveler feels buffeting and
shaking, as if the plane itself was rebelling against the storm. As
quickly as it comes, the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to
normal in a few rounds.</p>
<p>The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a location effect and a
mental effect. A group of travelers journeying together suffers the same
location effect. Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a DC
15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the traveler suffers the
mental effect as well. Roll a d20 twice and consult the Psychic Wind
Effects table to determine the location and mental effects.</p>

Plane Encounters</h3>
<p>Planar travelers and refugees from other planes wander the expanses
of the Astral Plane. The most prominent denizens of the Astral Plane are
the githyanki, an outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships,
slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched by the Astral. Their
city, Tu’narath, floats through the Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that
is actually the body of a dead god.</p>
<p>Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour the Astral Plane
for color pools leading to desired destinations. Characters who linger
for too long in the Astral might have an encounter with one or more
wandering angels, demons, devils, night hags, yugoloths, or other planar
travelers.</p>
<h2 ><a

Plane</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/816/c2-04.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/816/290/332/c2-04.png" /></a></p>
<p>The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. Its “shores,”
called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner
Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal is
limited to 60 feet. The plane’s depths comprise a region of swirling
mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal, where visibility is limited to 30
feet.</p>
<p>Characters can use the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness">etherealness</a>
spell to enter the Border Ethereal. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">plane shift</a>
spell allows transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, but
unless the intended destination is a specific location or a
teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on the
plane.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#BorderEthereal"></a>Border
Ethereal</h3>
<p>From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it
overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors
blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens
watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass,
and can’t see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely,
the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped
planes, except with the aid of magic.</p>
<p>Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can’t attack creatures on
the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane
is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and
solid objects on the overlapped plane don’t hamper the movement of a
creature in the Border Ethereal. The exceptions are certain magical
effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings.
This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, spying on
opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane
also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down
as easily as walking.</p>

spell or arrive by means of a <a

Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous color, and
passing through a curtain leads a traveler to a region of the Border
Ethereal connected to a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the
Feywild, or the Shadowfell. The color of the curtain indicates the plane
whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see the Ethereal Curtains

<p>Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from one plane to
another is unlike physical travel. Distance is meaningless, so although
travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it’s
impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A
trip between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 × 10 hours,
regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures
are considered to move at their normal speeds.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#EtherCyclones"></a>Ether
Cyclones</h3>
<p>An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins through the plane.
The cyclone appears abruptly, distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in
its path and carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive
Wisdom (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception">Perception</a>)
score of 15 or more receive 1d4 rounds of warning: a deep hum in the
ethereal matter. Travelers who can’t reach a curtain or portal leading
elsewhere suffer the cyclone’s effect. Roll a d20 and consult the Ether
Cyclone table to determine the effect on all creatures in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to extend the duration
of a journey. Each character in a group traveling together must make a
DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel
is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey’s travel time is
doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the Border Ethereal of a
random plane. Rarely, the cyclone tears a hole in the fabric of the
plane and hurls the party into the Astral Plane.</p>

<p>Most encounters in the Border Ethereal are with creatures on the
Material Plane whose senses or abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane
(<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16978-phase-spider">phase
spiders</a>, for example). <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16871-ghost">Ghosts</a> also
move freely between the Ethereal and Material Planes.</p>
<p>In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other travelers,
particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such as elementals, genies, and
<a

as well as the occasional celestial, fiend, or fey.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Feywild"></a>Feywild</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/817/c2-05.png"></a></p>
<p>The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft
lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a realm of
everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights bobbing in the
gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The
sky is alight with the faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never
truly sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, dusky and
low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the seelie fey that
compose the Summer Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles
and syrupy fens — perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt their
prey.</p>
<p>The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material Plane, an alternate
dimension that occupies the same cosmological space. The landscape of
the Feywild mirrors the natural world but turns its features into
spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the Material Plane, a
mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal
fire towers in the Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane
might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great beauty. A marsh
could be reflected as a vast black bog of sinister character. And moving
to the Feywild from old ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler
at the door of an archfey’s castle.</p>
<p>The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such as elves, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16849-dryad">dryads</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17005-satyr">satyrs</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17192-pixie">pixies</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17020-sprite">sprites</a>, as
well as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16821-centaur">centaurs</a> and
magical creatures such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16809-blink-dog">blink

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17037-treant">treants</a>, and
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17042-unicorn">unicorns</a>.
The darker regions of the plane are home to such malevolent creatures as
hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#FeyCrossings"></a>Fey
Crossings</h3>
<p>Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the Material Plane
that have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild, creating a portal where
the two planes touch. A traveler passes through a fey crossing by
entering a clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it
seems like he or she has simply walked into the Feywild with a step. To
an observer, the traveler is there one moment and gone the next.</p>
<p>Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings open
infrequently. A crossing might open only during a full moon, on the dawn
of a particular day, or for someone carrying a certain type of item. A
fey crossing can be closed permanently if the land on either side is
dramatically altered — for example, if a castle is built over the
clearing on the Material Plane.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulesFeywildMagic"></a>Optional
Rules: Feywild Magic</h3>
<p>Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away
to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without
having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm
they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to
the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time
flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their
visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange
magic that suffuses the plane.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#MemoryLoss"></a>Memory
Loss</h4>
<p>A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do
any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature
that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the
Feywild. On a successful save, the creature’s memories remain intact but
are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the
creature’s lost memories.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TimeWarp"></a>Time
Warp</h4>
<p>While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might
spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more
time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after
spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that
works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp
table. A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish">wish</a> spell
can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful
fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the
beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas">geas</a> spell and complete
a quest after the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish">wish</a> spell is cast.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Shadowfell"></a>Shadowfell</h2>
<p>The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of
black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from
everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the
sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.</p>
<p>The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as
the Feywild. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to
the Material Plane. Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable
on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped — distorted
reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain
stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the
Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a
heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A
forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out
to snare travelers’ cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip
those who pass by.</p>
<p>Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this bleak plane, as do
other creatures that thrive in the gloom, including <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16826-cloaker">cloakers</a> and
<a

<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#ShadowCrossings"></a>Shadow
Crossings</h3>
<p>Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the
veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is so thin that
creatures can walk from one plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the
corner of a dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an open
grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places where spirits or the
stench of death lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs.
They manifest only in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light’s
kiss.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#DomainsofDread"></a>Domains
of Dread</h3>
<p>In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach horrific
demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of terrible evil. The best
known of these is the valley of Barovia, overlooked by the towering
spires of Castle Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, the
first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the Dark Powers created
these domains as prisons for these “darklords,” and through cruelty or
carelessness trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleShadowfellDespair"></a>Optional
Rule: Shadowfell Despair</h3>
<p>A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. Extended forays to
this plane can afflict characters with despair, as reflected in this
optional rule.</p>
<p>When you deem it appropriate, though usually not more than once per
day, you can require a character not native to the Shadowfell to make a
DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by
despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the Shadowfell
Despair table. You can substitute different despair effects of your own
creation.</p>

<p>If a character is already suffering a despair effect and fails the
saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one. After
finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair
with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it’s harder
to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) On a successful save, the
despair effect ends for that character.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/calm-emotions">calm

effect that removes a curse.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#InnerPlanes"></a>Inner
Planes</h2>
<p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its
echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all worlds were
made. The four Elemental Planes — Air, Earth, Fire, and Water — form a
ring around the Material Plane, suspended within a churning realm known
as the Elemental Chaos. These planes are all connected, and the border
regions between them are sometimes described as distinct planes in their
own right.</p>
<p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material
Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four
Elemental Planes resemble places in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land,
sea, and sky. But the dominant element exerts a strong influence on the
environment, reflecting its fundamental qualities.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this inner ring include <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17100-aarakocra">aarakocra</a>,
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16794-azer">azers</a>, <a

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17004-salamander">salamanders</a>,
and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17066-xorn">xorn</a>.
Some originated on the Material Plane, and all can travel to the
Material Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and survive
there.</p>
<p>As they extend farther from the Material Plane, the Elemental Planes
become increasingly alien and hostile. Here, in the outermost regions,
the elements exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth,
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any foreign
substance is extremely rare; little air can be found in the outermost
reaches of the Plane of Earth, and earth is all but impossible to find
in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less
hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than the border regions
are. Such regions are little known, so when discussing the Plane of
Fire, for example, a speaker usually means the border region.</p>
<p>The outermost regions are largely the domains of elemental spirits
barely recognizable as creatures. The creatures usually called
elementals dwell here, including the Elemental Princes of Evil
(primordial beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits that
spellcasters can bind into <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17148-galeb-duhr">galeb

<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17208-water-weird">water
weirds</a>. These elemental creatures don’t need food or other
sustenance on their home planes, because they are sustained by the
elemental energies that saturate those planes.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#ElementalChaos"></a>Elemental
Chaos</h3>
<p>At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure elements
dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies
and colliding substance called the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be
found here as well, but they usually don’t stay long, preferring the
comfort of their native planes. Reports indicate the existence of weird
hybrid elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but such creatures are
seldom seen on other planes.</p>

<p>The essential nature of air is movement, animation, and inspiration.
Air is the breath of life, the winds of change, the fresh breeze that
clears away the fog of ignorance and the stuffiness of old ideas.</p>
<p>The Plane of Air is an open expanse with constant winds of varying
strength. Here and there, chunks of earth drift in the openness — the
remnants of failed invasions by denizens of the Plane of Earth. These
earth motes serve as homes for the creatures of elemental air, and many
motes are covered with lush vegetation. Other creatures live on cloud
banks infused with enough magic to become solid surfaces, strong enough
to support towns and castles.</p>
<p>Drifting cloud banks can obscure visibility in any direction in the
plane. Storms are frequent, mostly on par with a strong thunderstorm but
occasionally more like fierce tornadoes or mighty hurricanes. The air is
mild, except near the Plane of Water (where it is biting cold) and the
Plane of Fire (where it is searing hot). Rain and snow fall only in the
part of the plane nearest to the Plane of Water.</p>
<p>Most of the Plane of Air is a complex web of air streams, currents,
and winds called the <strong>Labyrinth Winds</strong>. These range from
stiff breezes to howling gales that can rip a creature apart. Even the
most skilled flying creatures must navigate these currents carefully,
flying with the winds, not against them.</p>
<p>Here and there among the Labyrinth Winds are hidden realms reachable
only by following a particular sequence of flowing winds, and thus
largely protected against attackers. One such realm is fabled
<strong>Aaqa</strong>, a shining domain of silver spires and verdant
gardens atop a fertile earth mote. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa are dedicated
to law and good, and they maintain a vigilant watch against the
depredations of elemental evil and the encroachment of the Elemental
Chaos. They are served by aarakocra and a little-known race called the
vaati.</p>
<p>The region of the Plane of Air nearest the Great Conflagration is
called the <strong>Sirocco Straits</strong>. Hot, dry winds scour the
earth motes in this area to dry and barren chunks of rock. Gargoyles and
their allies from the Plane of Earth gather here to launch raids into
the realm of Aaqa.</p>
<p>Between the Sea of Fire (on the Plane of Fire) and the Sirocco
Straits is a towering firestorm called the <strong>Great
Conflagration</strong>, sometimes called the Plane of Ash. Howling winds
from the Plane of Air mix with the cinder storms and lava of the Plane
of Fire to create an endless storm front — a wall of flames, smoke, and
ash. The thick ash obscures sight beyond a few dozen feet, and the
battering winds make travel difficult. Here and there, ash clusters into
floating realms where outlaws and fugitives take shelter.</p>
<p>At the other end of the plane, near the Frostfell (the plane of ice
that borders the Plane of Water), is a region of frigid winds called the
<strong>Mistral Reach</strong>. These gales drive snowstorms into the
Frostfell and away from it, toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes
in the reach are covered with snow and ice.</p>
<h3 ><a

<p>Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and tradition.
The plane’s position opposite the Plane of Air in the ring of the
Elemental Planes reflects its opposition to almost everything air
represents.</p>
<p>The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising higher than any
mountain range in the Material Plane. It has no sun of its own, and no
air surrounds the peaks of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the
plane arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the
mountains.</p>
<p>The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called the Great Dismal
Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is home to the capital city of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17142-dao">dao</a>, the
<strong>City of Jewels</strong>. The dao take great pride in their
wealth and send teams across the plane in search of new veins of ore and
gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, every building and
significant object in the city is made from precious stones and metals,
including the slender gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings.
The city is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao
population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is punishable
by death, with punishment extending to the thief’s relatives.</p>
<p>The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on the Plane of
Fire) are called the <strong>Furnaces</strong>. Lava seeps through their
caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The dao have great forges and
smelting furnaces here to process their ores and shape their precious
metals.</p>
<p>The border region between the planes of Water and Earth is a horrid
swamp where twisted, gnarled trees and thick, stinging vines grow from
the dense muck and slime. Here and there within the <strong>Swamp of
Oblivion</strong> (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and
pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes.
The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above
the muck. Most are built on platforms between trees, but a few stand on
stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud of
the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink down into it.</p>
<p>It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of Oblivion can’t be
found again for at least a century. Now and then, a desperate soul casts
an artifact of power into this place, removing it from the multiverse
for a time. The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to brave the
monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in search of these
treasures.</p>
<p>The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of Oblivion is called the
<strong>Mud Hills</strong>. Landslides constantly wear away the slopes
of the hills, sending cascades of earth and stone into the bottomless
swamp. The Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land,
pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing.</p>

<p>Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At its worst, it is
cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its
best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion,
and the flame of desire.</p>
<p>A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of
Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at
noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display
a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most
business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the darker
hours.</p>
<p>The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds and thick ash.
Although the air is breathable, creatures not native to the plane must
cover their mouths and eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16854-efreeti">efreet</a> use
magic to keep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, but
elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least blustery and rises
to hurricane force during the worst storms.</p>
<p>The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the
Material Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see “Extreme
Heat” in chapter 5, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat">Adventure
Environments</a>”). The deeper one goes into the plane, the rarer water
becomes. Beyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, so
travelers must carry their own supplies or produce water by magic.</p>
<p>The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast <strong>Cinder
Wastes</strong>, a great expanse of black cinders and embers crossed by
rivers of lava. Roving bands of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17004-salamander">salamanders</a>
battle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the efreet. Ancient
ruins dot the desert — remnants of forgotten civilizations.</p>
<p>A great range of volcanic mountains called the <strong>Fountains of
Creation</strong> is home to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16794-azer">azers</a>. These
rocky peaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around the Cinder
Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. At the edge of the plane,
the mountains are also called the Plane of Magma. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16862-fire-giant">Fire
giants</a> and red dragons make their homes here, as well as creatures
from the neighboring planes.</p>
<p>Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane of Air and pools
into a great lava sea, called the <strong>Sea of Fire</strong>, sailed
by efreet and azers in great brass ships. Islands of obsidian and basalt
jut up from the sea, dotted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful
red dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands the <strong>City of
Brass</strong>.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheCityofBrass"></a>The
City of Brass</h4>
<p>Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is the City of
Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This is the fabled city of the
efreet, and its ornate spires and metal walls reflect their grandiose
and cruel nature. True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in
the city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the vibrant energy
of the place.</p>
<p>Adventurers frequently come here on quests for legendary magic. If
it’s possible to buy magic items at all, the City of Brass is the most
likely place to find any item for sale, though the price might well be
more than gold. The efreet are fond of trading in favors, especially
when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhaps a magical disease
or poison can be cured only with something that must be purchased in the
bazaars of the city.</p>
<p>The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal Palace, where the
tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns supreme, surrounded by efreet
nobles and a host of servants, guardians, and sycophants.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlaneofWater"></a>Plane
of Water</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/822/c2-10.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/822/300/652/c2-10.png" /></a></p>
<p>The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the
leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide,
the nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of
sympathy and healing. Given time, it can erode all in its path.</p>
<p>A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of Water, seeming to rise
and set from within the water at the visible edge of the horizon.
Several times a day, however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge
of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of lightning, before
clearing up again. At night, a glittering array of stars and auroras
bedecks the sky.</p>
<p>The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the <strong>Sea of
Worlds</strong>, dotted here and there with atolls and islands that rise
up from enormous coral reefs that seem to stretch forever into the
depths. The storms that move across the sea sometimes create temporary
portals to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane of Water.
Surviving vessels from countless worlds and navies ply these waters with
little hope of ever returning home.</p>
<p>The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. If the sea isn’t
calm, it is battered by storms. On rare occasions, a tremor in the
planar firmament sends a rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping
entire islands and driving ships down to the reefs.</p>
<p>Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of Worlds, called the
<strong>Sea of Light</strong> because of the sunlight filtering down
into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft castles and fortresses in the
coral reefs. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17143-marid">marids</a> are the
distant stewards of this region, content to allow the lesser folk to
compete for territory. The nominal emperor of the marids dwells in the
<strong>Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls</strong>, an opulent palace made
of coral and studded with pearls.</p>
<p>The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight reaches, are
called the <strong>Darkened Depths</strong>. Horrid creatures dwell
here, and the absolute cold and crushing pressure mean a swift end to
creatures accustomed to the surface or the Sea of Light. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16940-kraken">Krakens</a> and
other mighty leviathans claim this realm.</p>
<p>Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is hotly contested
by the few air-breathers that live on the plane. Fleets of rafts and
ships lashed together serve as solid ground where nothing else is
available. Most natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea
and thus ignore these habitations.</p>
<p>One of the few actual islands on the plane is the <strong>Isle of
Dread</strong>. The island is connected to the Material Plane by means
of a regular storm that sweeps over the island. Travelers who know the
strange tides and currents of the plane can travel between worlds
freely, but the storms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the
island’s shore.</p>
<p>The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp of Oblivion (on
the Plane of Earth) is called the <strong>Silt Flats</strong>. The water
is thick with soil and sludge, and turns into muddy ground before giving
way to the great swamp between the planes.</p>
<p>At the other extreme of the plane is the <strong>Sea of Ice</strong>,
bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with icebergs and
sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving creatures that inhabit the
Frostfell. Drifting icebergs can carry these creatures farther into the
Plane of Water to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas.</p>
<p>The <strong>Frostfell</strong>, also called the Plane of Ice, forms
the border between the planes of Air and Water and is a seemingly
endless glacier swept by constant, raging blizzards. Frozen caverns
twist through the Plane of Ice, home to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17096-yeti">yetis</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16995-remorhaz">remorhazes</a>,
white dragons, and other creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane
engage in a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure their
survival.</p>
<p>Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the Frostfell a dangerous
place to travel. Most planar voyagers keep to the air, braving the
powerful winds and driving snow to avoid setting foot on the great
glacier.</p>

<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OuterPlanes"></a>Outer
Planes</h2>
<p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the
multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the direction, thought, and purpose
for its construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes
as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer
Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p>
<p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must
be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes aren’t literally places at
all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought
and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the
perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border region, while extensive
spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>
<p>Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially,
many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of
the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at a whim of the
powerful forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake them
completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence to better
fulfill their divine needs.</p>
<p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The
perceptible regions of the planes can seem quite small, but they can
also stretch on to what seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a
guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a
single day — if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take
weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p>
<p>The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that
correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality, which is
represented by the Outlands, described in the section on “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OtherPlanes">Other
Planes</a>”) and the shades of distinction between them.</p>

</table>
<p>The planes with an element of good in their nature are called the
<strong>Upper Planes</strong>, while those with an element of evil are
the <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. A plane’s alignment is its essence,
and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s alignment
experiences a sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits
Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil
creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, including
angels, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16832-couatl">couatls</a>, and
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16977-pegasus">pegasi</a>.
The Lower Planes are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, and
their ilk. The planes in between host their own unique denizens: the
construct race of modrons inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called
slaadi thrive in Limbo.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#LayersoftheOuterPlanes"></a>Layers
of the Outer Planes</h3>
<p>Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct environments or
realms. These realms are often imagined and depicted as a stack of
related parts of the same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers.
For example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer cake, the
Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has a seemingly endless number
of layers.</p>
<p>Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a multilayered
plane. This layer is variously depicted as the top or bottom layer,
depending on the plane. As the arrival point for most visitors, the
first layer functions like a city gate for that plane.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TravelingtheOuterPlanes"></a>Traveling
the Outer Planes</h3>
<p>Traveling between the Outer Planes isn’t dissimilar from reaching the
Outer Planes in the first place. Characters traveling by means of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection">astral
projection</a> spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and
there search out a color pool leading to the desired destination.
Characters can also use <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">plane shift</a> to
reach a different plane more directly. Most often, though, characters
use portals — either a portal that links the two planes directly or a
portal leading to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#SigilCityofDoors">Sigil,
City of Doors</a>, which holds portals to all the planes.</p>
<p>Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes together: the River
Styx and the Infinite Staircase. Other planar crossings might exist in
your campaign, such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower Planes
and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes, or it might be possible to
walk from one plane to another in your cosmology.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheRiverStyx"></a>The
River Styx</h4>
<p>This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and the putrid remains
of battles along its banks. Any creature other than a fiend that tastes
or touches the water is affected by a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/feeblemind">feeblemind</a> spell.
The DC of the Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15.</p>
<p>The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, the Nine Hells,
Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium. Tributaries of the
Styx snake onto lower layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of
the Styx winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing passage
from one layer of that plane to the next.</p>
<p>Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed by pilots
skilled in negotiating the unpredictable currents and eddies of the
river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers from
plane to plane. Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of
dead creatures from the Material Plane.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheInfiniteStaircase"></a>The
Infinite Staircase</h4>
<p>The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral staircase that
connects the planes. An entrance to the Infinite Staircase usually
appears as a nondescript door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing
with an equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The Infinite
Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and descends, going from
simple stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging in
radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravitational
orientation. It is said that one can find one’s heart’s desire on the
Infinite Staircase through diligent searching of each landing.</p>
<p>Doors to the Infinite Staircase are often tucked away in dusty,
half-forgotten places that no one frequents or pays any attention to. On
any given plane, there can be multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase,
though entrances aren’t common knowledge and are occasionally guarded by
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16840-deva">devas</a>,
sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful monsters.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRules"></a>Optional
Rules</h3>
<p>Each of the Outer Planes has peculiar characteristics that make
traveling through it a unique experience. A plane’s influence can affect
visitors in various ways, such as causing them to take on personality
traits or flaws that reflect the disposition of the plane, or even shift
alignment to more closely match the native inhabitants of the plane.
Each plane’s description includes one or more optional rules that you
can use to help make the adventurers’ experiences on that plane
memorable.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulePsychicDissonance"></a>Optional
Rule: Psychic Dissonance</h4>
<p>Each of the Outer Planes emanates a psychic dissonance that affects
visitors of an incompatible alignment — good creatures on the Lower
Planes, evil ones on the Upper Planes — if they spend too much time on
the plane. You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At
the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must
make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
gains one level of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>.
Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn’t have the
same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#MountCelestia"></a>Mount
Celestia</h3>
<p>The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises from a shining
Silver Sea to heights barely visible and utterly incomprehensible, with
seven plateaus marking its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model
of justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, where angels
and champions of good guard against incursions of evil. It is one of the
few places on the planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its
inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as possible. Countless
creatures aim to reach the highest and most sublime peak of the
mountain, but only the purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills
even the most jaded of travelers with awe.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/824/c2-12.png"></a></p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleBlessedBeneficence"></a>Optional
Rule: Blessed Beneficence</h4>
<p>In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here,
good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the
plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless">bless</a> spell as long as
they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the
plane grants a good creature the benefit of a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration">lesser
restoration</a> spell.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Bytopia"></a>Bytopia</h3>
<p>The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are similar yet
opposite: one is a tamed, pastoral landscape and the other an untamed
wilderness, yet both reflect the plane’s goodness and its acceptance of
law and order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of productive work,
the satisfaction of a job well done. The goodness flowing through the
plane creates feelings of goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling
there.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulePervasiveGoodwill"></a>Optional
Rule: Pervasive Goodwill</h4>
<p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is
neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful good
or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature’s current
alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn’t leave
the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts
to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel
evil and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original
alignment.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Elysium"></a>Elysium</h3>
<p>Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and compassion,
and a welcome refuge for planar travelers seeking a safe haven. The
plane’s bucolic landscapes glimmer with life and beauty in their prime.
Tranquility seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the plane.
It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where tears of joy glisten
on many a cheek.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleOverwhelmingJoy"></a>Optional
Rule: Overwhelming Joy</h4>
<p>Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by
overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each
long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane
before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the
creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does
everything in its power to return to the plane. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel evil
and good</a> spell removes this effect from the creature.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheBeastlands"></a>The
Beastlands</h3>
<p>The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests ranging from
moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden pines, of thick jungles where the
branches are woven so tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains
where grains and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The
plane embodies nature’s wildness and beauty, but it also speaks to the
animal within all living things.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/825/c2-13.png"></a></p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleHuntersParadise"></a>Optional
Rule: Hunter’s Paradise</h4>
<p>Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and stalking
capabilities improved, and characters have advantage on Wisdom (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling">Animal
Handling</a>), Wisdom (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception">Perception</a>),

checks while there.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleBeastTransformation"></a>Optional
Rule: Beast Transformation</h4>
<p>Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the slayer must
succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become transformed (as the
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph">polymorph</a>
spell) into the type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature
retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long
rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a
successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After
three failed saving throws, the transformation can be undone only by a
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse">remove curse</a>
spell or similar magic.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Arborea"></a>Arborea</h3>
<p>Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods and deep
affections, of whim backed by steel, and of passions that blaze brightly
until they burn out. Its good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to
fighting evil, but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with
devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as honored as joy in
Arborea. There the mountains and forests are extravagantly massive and
beautiful, and every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits
that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly.</p>
<p>Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elves born on this
plane have the celestial type and are wild at heart, ready to battle
evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they look and behave like normal
elves.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleIntenseYearning"></a>Optional
Rule: Intense Yearning</h4>
<p>Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the
visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5,
plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature
becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the
effect persists, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the
end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending
the effect on a success. A <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel evil
and good</a> spell removes this effect from the creature.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Ysgard"></a>Ysgard</h3>
<p>Ysgard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep fjords, and
windswept battlefields, with summers that are long and hot, and winters
that are wickedly cold and unforgiving. Its continents float above
oceans of volcanic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous as to
hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and other
beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to test their mettle not only against the
plane itself, but also against giants, dragons, and other terrible
creatures that thunder across Ysgard’s vast terrain.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleImmortalWrath"></a>Optional
Rule: Immortal Wrath</h4>
<p>Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields
of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed
by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the
next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all
conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Limbo"></a>Limbo</h3>
<p>Limbo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of impermanent matter
and energy. Stone melts into water that freezes into metal, then turns
into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on
in an endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more
ordinary landscapes — bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even
burbling streams — drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a
nightmarish riot.</p>
<p>Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float in place.
A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction by merely
thinking of the desired direction of travel.</p>
<p>Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very
disciplined and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own
invention within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for
years. A simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less
than a minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes,
vanishes, or turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this
chaos, creating nothing, whereas <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17151-githzerai-monk">githzerai
monks</a> build entire monasteries with their minds.</p>
<p><a

<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulePoweroftheMind"></a>Optional
Rule: Power of the Mind</h4>
<p>As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to
mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of
it. The DC depends on the object’s size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small,
DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a
successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for
every point by which it beat the DC.</p>
<p>A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to
alter a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried. The same
rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object’s size: DC
10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or
larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another
nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball
of fire.</p>
<p>Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check
to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends
on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius
sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by
5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being
altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this
ability again.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Pandemonium"></a>Pandemonium</h3>
<p>Pandemonium is a plane of overwhelming chaos, a great mass of rock
riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and
dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open
flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation
possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10
feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on
hearing.</p>
<p>Most of the plane’s inhabitants are creatures that were banished to
the plane with no hope of escape, and the incessant winds have driven
many to delirium and forced others to take shelter in places where the
winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleMadWinds"></a>Optional
Rule: Mad Winds</h4>
<p>A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent
among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level
of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>.
A creature that reaches six levels of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>
while on this plane doesn’t die. Instead, the creature gains a random
form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness">Running
the Game</a>.” Finishing a long rest doesn’t reduce a creature’s <a

level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheAbyss"></a>The
Abyss</h3>
<p>The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its
virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling
forms.</p>
<p>Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although
no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer
also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what
one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling,
or corroded state.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleAbyssalCorruption"></a>Optional
Rule: Abyssal Corruption</h4>
<p>A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a
DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes
corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the
effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption
effects of your own creation.</p>
<p>After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15
Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends.
A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel
evil and good</a> spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the
effect.</p>
<p>If a corrupted creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 + 2 days,
its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel evil
and good</a> spell on the creature restores its original alignment.</p>

Layers</h4>
<p>The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords who rule them,
as the following examples illustrate. More information about the demon
lords can be found in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gaping Maw.</em></strong> Demogorgon’s layer in the
Abyss is a vast wilderness of brutality and horror known as the Gaping
Maw, where even powerful demons are overcome by fear. Reflecting
Demogorgon’s dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval
continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless
expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer
from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower
is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the
fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without their minds
being crushed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thanatos.</em></strong> If Orcus had his way, all planes
would resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures would
become undead under his control. Under its black sky, Thanatos is a land
of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted
black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the
landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and
graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus
rules Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian
and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion’s End, the
palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes
of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Demonweb.</em></strong> Lolth’s layer is an immense
network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like
chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other
objects hang as if caught in a spider’s snare. The nature of Lolth’s web
creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in
from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds that figure into the schemes
of the Spider Queen. Lolth’s servants also build dungeons amid the
webbing, trapping and hunting Lolth’s hated enemies within crisscrossing
corridors of web-mortared stone.</p>
<p>Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless Demonweb Pits where the
Spider Queen dwells. There, Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens — <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17127-yochlol">yochlol</a>
demons created to serve her and which outrank mightier demons while in
the Spider Queen’s realm.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Endless Maze.</em></strong> Baphomet’s layer of the
Abyss is a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the Horned
King’s enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing jumble of crooked hallways
and myriad chambers, the palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat
concealing a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels leading
deeper into the fortress.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Triple Realm.</em></strong> The Dark Prince Graz’zt
rules over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three layers of the
Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic Argent Palace in the city of
Zelatar, whose bustling markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from
across the multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and perverse
delights. By Graz’zt’s command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer
of civility and courtly comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm
holds as much danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar visitors
can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities and in forests whose
trees have serpents for branches.</p>
<p><strong><em>Death Dells.</em></strong> Yeenoghu rules a layer of
ravines known as Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. Even
the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, snare the unwary.
Yeenoghu’s servants, helping to sate their master’s hunger as he prowls
his kingdom seeking prey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for
release in the Gnoll Lord’s realm.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Carceri"></a>Carceri</h3>
<p>The model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri is a plane of
desolation and despair. Its six layers hold vast bogs, fetid jungles,
windswept deserts, jagged mountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All
form a miserable home for the traitors and backstabbers that are trapped
on this prison plane.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulePrisonPlane"></a>Optional
Rule: Prison Plane</h4>
<p>No one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave the plane
by any spell ot-eh than a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish">wish</a> simply fail.
Portals and gates that open onto the plane become one-way only. Secret
ways out of the plane exist, but they are hidden and well guarded by
traps and deadly monsters.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Hades"></a>Hades</h3>
<p>The layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms — places without joy,
hope, or passion. A gray land with an ashen sky, Hades is the
destination of many souls that are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper
Planes or the fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls become
larvae and spend eternity in this place that lacks a sun, a moon, stars,
or seasons. Leaching away color and emotion, this gloom is more than
most visitors can stand. The “<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#ShadowfellDespair">Shadowfell
Despair</a>” rule earlier in this chapter can be used to represent a
visitor’s despair.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleVileTransformation"></a>Optional
Rule: Vile Transformation</h4>
<p>At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor must make
a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one
level of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>,
which can’t be removed while the creature remains in Hades. If the
creature reaches six levels of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>,
it doesn’t die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into a
larva, whereupon all levels of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion">exhaustion</a>
afflicting the creature are removed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/27752-larva">larva</a>
is a miserable fiend that retains the facial features of its previous
form but has the body of a fat worm. A larva has only a few faint
memories of its previous life and the statistics in the larva stat
block.</p>
<p>Hades is crawling with larvae. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16965-night-hag">Night
hags</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich">liches</a>, and <a

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Gehenna"></a>Gehenna</h3>
<p>Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the birthplace of
the yugoloths, which dwell here in great numbers. A volcanic mountain
dominates each of the four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic
earthbergs drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains.</p>
<p>The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here difficult and
dangerous. The ground inclines at least 45 degrees almost everywhere. In
places, steep cliffs and deep canyons present more challenging
obstacles. Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious fumes or
searing flames.</p>
<p>Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The fiends living here
are among the greediest and most selfish in all the multiverse.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleCruelHindrance"></a>Optional
Rule: Cruel Hindrance</h4>
<p>The plane’s cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to help one
another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a beneficial effect,
including a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the
caster must first make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save,
the spell fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is
wasted.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheNineHells"></a>The
Nine Hells</h3>
<p>The Nine Hells of Baator inflame the imaginations of travelers, the
greed of treasure seekers, and the battle fury of all moral creatures.
It is the ultimate plane of law and evil and the epitome of premeditated
cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws of
their superiors, but they rebel within their individual castes. Most
undertake any plot, no matter how foul, to advance themselves. At the
very top of the hierarchy is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he
were to be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. Such is
the law of the Nine Hells.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRulePervasiveEvil"></a>Optional
Rule: Pervasive Evil</h4>
<p>Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane feel its
influence. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor
that isn’t evil must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature’s alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes
permanent if the creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 days.
Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day
spent on a plane other than the Nine Hells. Casting the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel evil
and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original
alignment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/827/c2-15.png"><img
src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/827/300/669/c2-15.png" /></a></p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheNineLayers"></a>The
Nine Layers</h4>
<p>The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are each ruled by
archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth
layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend
through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious
means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it
flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers
can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avernus.</em></strong> No planar portals connect directly
to the lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus’s orders. As such,
the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point for visitors to the
plane. Avernus is a rocky wasteland with rivers of blood and clouds of
biting flies. Fiery comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and
leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields are littered with
weapons and bones, showing where the legions of the Nine Hells met
enemies on their native soil and prevailed.</p>
<p>The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting her rival, Bel, who
has fallen out of Asmodeus’s favor and is forced to serve as Zariel’s
advisor. Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer,
ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells by Asmodeus in
accordance with some ancient contract (the terms of which are known only
to Tiamat and the Lords of the Nine).</p>
<p>Zariel’s seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel festooned with the
partially incinerated corpses of guests who failed to earn the
archduchess’s favor. Zariel appears as an angel whose once-beautiful
skin and wings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a furious
white light that can cause creatures looking upon her to burst into
flame.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dis.</em></strong> Dis, the second layer of the Nine
Hells, is a labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains rich
with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through the canyons, watched
over by the garrisons of iron fortresses perched atop jagged
pinnacles.</p>
<p>The second layer takes its name from its current lord, Dispater. A
manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is devilishly handsome, bearing
only small horns, a tail, and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from
a human. His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City of Dis,
a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the Nine Hells. Planar
travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16965-night-hag">night
hags</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16990-rakshasa">rakshasas</a>,
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/257235-incubus">incubi</a>,
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17027-succubus">succubi</a>,
and other fiends. Dispater collects a piece of every deal through
special provisions that are added to contracts signed on his layer of
the Nine Hells.</p>
<p>Dispater is one of Asmodeus’s most loyal and resourceful vassals, and
few beings in the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than
most devils with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their
souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil schemes in the
Material Plane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minauros.</em></strong> The third layer of the Nine Hells
is a stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer’s brown skies,
thick layers of scum cover its putrid surface, and yawning pits lie in
wait beneath the murk to engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of
ornately carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great city of
Minauros for which the layer is named.</p>
<p>The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air,
protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The Archduke of Minauros
resembles a massive serpent with the upper torso and head of a hairless,
horned humanoid. Mammon’s greed is legendary, and he is one of the few
archdevils who will trade favors for gold instead of souls. His lair is
piled high with treasures left behind by those who tried — and failed —
to best him in a deal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phlegethos.</em></strong> Phlegethos, the fourth layer,
is a fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew hurricanes of hot
wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic ash. Within the fire-filled caldera
of Phlegethos’s largest volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of
obsidian and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring down its
outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted centerpiece of a gigantic,
hellish fountain.</p>
<p>Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils who rule
Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial’s
daughter. Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes
civility, even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His
daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the blackest heart
in the Nine Hells. The alliance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for
both are aware that their mutual survival hinges on it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stygia.</em></strong> The fifth layer of the Nine Hells
is a freezing realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea
surrounds the layer, and its gloomy sky crackles with lightning.</p>
<p>Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is now encased deep in
the ice of Stygia as punishment. He rules this layer all the same,
communicating telepathically with his followers and servants, both in
the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the serpentine archdevil
Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus
to regain his rule. Geryon’s fall from grace has spurred much debate
within the infernal courts. No one is certain whether Asmodeus had some
secret cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryon’s
allegiance for some greater purpose.</p>
<p><strong><em>Malbolge.</em></strong> Malbolge, the sixth layer, has
outlasted many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess and the
archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and was struck down by
Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers
somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus’s
favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the sides of an
impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off from time to
time, creating deadly and deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants
of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves carved into the
mountainside.</p>
<p>Malbolge’s current archduchess is Asmodeus’s daughter, Glasya. She
resembles a succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked
tail. She inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her
father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of
Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy
yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth
lined with cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and
torments those who displease her.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maladomini.</em></strong> The seventh layer, Maladomini,
is ruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban landscape,
and between them lie empty quarries, crumbling roads, slag heaps, the
hollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.</p>
<p>The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated
fiend with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul’s form was
inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty.
Baalzebul is a miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long
conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a
curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus
occasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can
fathom, though some suspect that the Archduke of Nessus still respects
the worthiness of this fallen adversary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cania.</em></strong> Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine
Hells, is an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from bone.
Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of
Cania’s ruler, the brilliant and conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.</p>
<p>Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots
to seize the Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus’s
greatest enemy and ally, and the Archduke of Nessus appears to trust
Mephistopheles’s counsel when it is offered. Mephistopheles knows he
can’t depose Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation,
and so both wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each
other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further
complicating the relationship.</p>
<p>Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive horns and a
cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as do other archdevils, but he rarely
gives his time to any creatures not worthy of his personal attention.
His instincts are as razor sharp as Cania’s frigid winds, and it is said
that only Asmodeus has ever deceived or thwarted him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nessus.</em></strong> The lowest layer of the Nine Hells,
Nessus is a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses.
There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison their diabolical
legions and plot the conquest of the multiverse. At the center of the
layer stands a vast rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great
citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his infernal court.</p>
<p>Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is
also a prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping.
Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep
price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has claimed whole
kingdoms in the past for such favors.</p>
<p>Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, bearded humanoid with
small horns protruding from his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing
robes. He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen without his
ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is the most cunning and
well-mannered of archdevils. The ultimate evil he represents can be seen
only when he wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a
rage.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Acheron"></a>Acheron</h3>
<p>Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron cubes floating in
an airy void. Sometimes the cubes collide. Echoes of past collisions
linger throughout the plane, mingling with the sounds of armies
colliding. That’s the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the spirits
of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against orcs devoted to
Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, and legions assembled by other
warmongering gods.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OptionalRuleBloodlust"></a>Optional
Rule: Bloodlust</h4>
<p>Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing
that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a
creature gains <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints">temporary
hit points</a> equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a
hostile creature to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Mechanus"></a>Mechanus</h3>
<p>On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all
interlocked and turning according to their measure. The cogs seem to be
engaged in a calculation so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose.
Mechanus embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on those
who spend time here.</p>
<p>Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. The plane is also
home to the creator of the modrons: a godlike being called Primus.</p>

Rule: Law of Averages</h4>
<p>While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for
attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals 1d10 + 5
damage always deals 10 damage on Mechanus.</p>
<h4 ><a

Rule: Imposing Order</h4>
<p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that
isn’t lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature’s
alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than
Mechanus. Casting the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good">dispel evil
and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original
alignment.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Arcadia"></a>Arcadia</h3>
<p>Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees,
ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and cities laid
out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by
erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a
flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing
intrudes on harmony.</p>
<p>Night and day are determined by an orb that floats above Arcadia’s
highest peak. Half of the orb radiates sunlight and brings about the
day; the other half sheds moonlight and brings on the starry night. The
orb rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night across the
entire plane.</p>
<p>The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied demigods called the
Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the
Rain Queen. Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of weather
that king or queen controls.</p>
<p>Hidden below Arcadia’s beautiful mountains are numerous dwarven
kingdoms that have withstood the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on
this plane have the celestial type and are always brave and kindhearted,
but otherwise they look and behave like normal dwarves.</p>

Rule: Planar Vitality</h4>
<p>While on this plane, creatures can’t be <a

or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned">poisoned</a>,
and they are immune to disease and poison.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OtherPlanes"></a>Other
Planes</h2>
<p>A variety of realms exist between or beyond the other planes.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheOutlandsandSigil"></a>The
Outlands and Sigil</h3>
<p>The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. It is the plane
of neutrality, incorporating a little of everything and keeping all
aspects in a paradoxical balance — simultaneously concordant and in
opposition. The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, and
shallow rivers.</p>
<p>The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, those who
envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof,
calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular,
since the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great
Wheel in the first place.</p>
<p>Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the
gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to
one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of
the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in these
towns, so it isn’t unusual to see strange pairings, such as a celestial
and a fiend arguing in a tavern while sharing a fine bottle of wine.</p>
<p>Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the Outlands from a
heaven to a hell, a planar-themed campaign can be set there without the
need for planar travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes
come to being like a world on the Material Plane.</p>

href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#SigilCityofDoors"></a>Sigil,
City of Doors</h4>
<p>At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the
Spire — a needle-shaped mountain that rises high into the sky. Above
this mountain’s narrow peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its
myriad structures built on the ring’s inner rim. Creatures standing on
one of Sigil’s streets can see the city curve up over their heads and —
most disconcerting of all — the far side of the city directly overhead.
Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds
countless portals to other planes and worlds.</p>
<p>Sigil is a trader’s paradise. Goods, merchandise, and information
come here from across the planes. The city sustains a brisk trade in
information about the planes, particularly the command words or items
required for the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all
kinds are bought and sold here.</p>
<p>The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, a being as
old as gods and with purposes unknown to even the sages of her city. Is
Sigil her prison? Is she the fallen creator of the multiverse? No one
knows. Or if they do, they aren’t telling.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Demiplanes"></a>Demiplanes</h3>
<p>Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come into being by a
variety of means and boast their own physical laws. Some are created by
spells. Others exist naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the
rest of the multiverse. Theoretically, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift">plane shift</a>
spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency
required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to acquire. The <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate">gate</a> spell is more
reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>
<p>A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or large enough to
contain an entire realm. For example, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion">Mordenkainen’s
magnificent mansion</a> spell creates a demiplane consisting of a foyer
with multiple adjoining rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the
Ravenloft setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the sway of
its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a demiplane is connected to
the Material Plane or some other plane, entering it can be as simple as
stepping through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#TheFarRealm"></a>The
Far Realm</h3>
<p>The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be
an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws.
Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter
is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and
biology. Aberrations such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer">mind
flayers</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholders</a>
are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.</p>
<p>The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a
normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through
nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those
who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle
of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity.
Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities
there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles,
and horror.</p>
<p>The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are
still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm
within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded
in bloody terror and the portal’s location — even its home world — is
long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic
that mutates the area around them.</p>
<h2 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#KnownWorldsoftheMaterialPlane"></a>Known
Worlds of the Material Plane</h2>
<p>Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The most widely
known worlds are the ones that have been published as official campaign
settings for the D&amp;D game over the years. If your campaign takes
place on one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your
campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly from what’s in
print.</p>
<p>On <strong>Toril</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten
Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand amid the remains of
ancient empires and realms long forgotten. The world is vast, its
dungeons rich with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerûn,
Toril includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, and Maztica.</p>
<p>On <strong>Oerth</strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the
Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and Mordenkainen are driven by
greed or ambition. The hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free
City of Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and archmagi, rife with
adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish realm in the north,
threatening all civilization.</p>
<p>On <strong>Krynn</strong> (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance
setting), the return of the gods is overshadowed by the rise of the evil
dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons and dragonarmies, which plunge the
continent of Ansalon into war.</p>
<p>On <strong>Athas</strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark
Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a human life. The
gods have abandoned this desert world, where powerful sorcerer-kings
rule as tyrants, and metal is a scarce and precious commodity.</p>
<p>On <strong>Eberron</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron
setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold war fueled by
political intrigue. On the continent of Khorvaire, magic is commonplace,
dragonmarked houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles make
travel to the far corners of the world possible.</p>
<p>On <strong>Aebrynis</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the
Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines carve up the
continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, guildmasters, and great
wizards balance the demands of rulership against the threat of horrible
abominations born from the blood of an evil god.</p>
<p>On <strong>Mystara</strong> (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the
earliest editions of the D&amp;D game), diverse cultures, savage
monsters, and warring empires collide. The world is further shaped by
the meddling of the Immortals — former adventurers raised to nearly
divine status.</p>
