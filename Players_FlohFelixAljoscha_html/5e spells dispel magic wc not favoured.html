This spell will remove all spell effects on any one unit, or one terrain
spell effect (such as hallucinatory terrain) within 6 hexes of the
caster. It may fail to remove spell effects of casters of a higher
level; a proficiency throw on 1d20 of 1 + 1 per level of difference is
required.</p>

Range: | 120’ | |:——— |:————- | | Divine | 4 | | Arcane | 3 | |
Duration: | instantaneous |</p>
<p>The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been
cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least
their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose
whether to cast dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an
area.</p>
<p>If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spells and spell-like
effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon
an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or
effect cast by a character of equal or lower level than the dispel magic
caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level
casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic
will fail for each level the spell or effect exceeds the caster level.
For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th
level caster has a 20% chance of failure.</p>
<p>Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically
includes any magical disease, geas, quest, petrification from a flesh to
stone spell, and any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the
reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.</p>
