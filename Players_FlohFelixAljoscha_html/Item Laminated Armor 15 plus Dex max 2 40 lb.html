<h1 >Item Laminated
Armor 15 plus Dex max 2 40 lb</h1>
<p>Laminated Armor. This is an older armor-type, nowadays often replaced
by the cheaper scale mail or the flexible chainmail. However, some old
laminated sets of armor are still around and there are blacksmiths who
actually prefer them because of their greater protective capability.
Some of Ambria’s noble houses still dress in this type of armor, for
sentimental… or, as they claim, “traditional” reasons. Laminated armor
can only protect the torso, shoulders and hips – arms and legs are
usually dressed in studded leather (included in the Armor Class rating)
to maintain mobility.</p>
