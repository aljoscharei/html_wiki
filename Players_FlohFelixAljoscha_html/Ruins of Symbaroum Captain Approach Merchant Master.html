<h1 >Ruins of
Symbaroum Captain Approach Merchant Master</h1>
<p>These captains are those who have taken the lessons of military life
and applied them to ordinary affairs, especially mercantile concerns.
After all, a merchant caravan in the wild is in almost as much danger as
a scouting party along the front lines. Many merchant masters lead
expeditions paid for by <a href="future%20shares.html">future shares</a>.
Some of the benefits from this approach provide equipment to the party
members. These benefits are considered to be paid for by the trading
efforts of the group that mostly happen “off-screen”. Also, if a
character loses an item that the merchant master gave them for whatever
reason its loss should be temporary and its replacement automatic and at
no cost to the character. <a
