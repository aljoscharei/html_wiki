Mark</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +2 to Charisma<br />
You have a mystical mark somewhere on your body, maybe a birthmark or a
scar gained later in life, that requires effort to conceal. Whatever the
origin, you are at risk of being mistaken for having a blight-mark. In
situations when it is relevant, you must pass an opposed Charisma
(Deception) versus Wisdom (Perception) roll or attract unwanted
attention (which can take different forms depending on the
situation).</p>
