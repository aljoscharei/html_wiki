<p>You summon some measure of the darkness that plagues your soul and
send it outwards as a bolt of blackness at a creature within range. The
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be <a
href="Restrained.html">Restrained</a> by the magic as it envelops them
like shadowy tentacles. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt
a Strength saving throw to break free. If the creature’s size is larger
than the caster’s it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher,
you can target one additional creature for each level above 1st.</p>
