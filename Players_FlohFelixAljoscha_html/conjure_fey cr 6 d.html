<h1 >Conjure Fey</h1>
<p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey
spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It
appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey
creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
ends.<br />
The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the
duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It
obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by
you), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue
any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile
creatures but otherwise takes no actions.<br />
If your concentration is broken, the fey creature doesn’t disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward
you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled fey
creature can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you
summoned it.<br />
The GM has the fey creature’s statistics.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1
for each slot level above 6th.</p>
