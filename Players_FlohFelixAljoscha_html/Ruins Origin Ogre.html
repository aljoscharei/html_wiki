<h1 >Ruins Origin Ogre</h1>
<p>Ogres are soLitary and odd creatures that come wandering out of the
depths of Davokar, fully grown but devoid of memories and with no sense
of identity. It is up to the humans or goblins who eventually take them
in to give them a name and teach them the ways of the world.</p>
<p>The tales told of ogres vary from being hilarious to horrific. What
is known is that the witches of Davokar sometimes take ogres under their
wing and raise them to be guards and servants. Explorers have also
reported that an Ambrian outpost near the Black Pitch Mire has adopted
an ogre called Armstout and the soldiers there have the giant dig
ditches, lift heavy equipment and draw the plow from time to time. A
similar phenomenon is the ogres that are snatched by goblin gangs in the
slums of Yndaros to serve as heavy-handed enforcers.</p>
<p>In southern Davokar they tell of the companions Deterror and Vitrona,
the latter a skillful scout employed by the witches and the former a
huge ogre and the scout’s best friend. Word of the duo has also reached
Thistle Hold where they have become the subjects of a series of popular
songs, supposedly recounting their adventures in the ruins of
Symbaroum.</p>
<p>Ogre traits</p>
<p>Though they do not realize it, all ogres share a common origin and
have many more similarities than differences despite their varied
upbringings.<br />
- Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2.
Increase any other ability score by 1.<br />
- Age. Ogres have no sense of their ‘birth’ and it is up to other people
to keep track of their age in whatever way they see fit. The general
consensus is that ogres can live for several decades at least, and at
least one ogre is known to have reached 100 years of service to the
witches, plus however many years spent wandering in the wild before
that. - Size. Ogres tend to be from 7 to 8 feet tall and weigh from 250
to 350 pounds. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first

<p>Ogre Names</p>
<p>Ogres seem to lack any given names and are therefore nicknamed by
people around them. These nicknames often allude to the ogres’ size or
the taciturn calm that many mistake for stupidity. Ordo Magica
speculates that such lonesome creatures actually have no use for proper
names – the ogre knows who it is and that is enough. • Ogre names:
Bauta, Ugly, Angry, Odd, Gawky, Heavy, Big Brute, Roughneck, Freak, Oaf,
Ox, Rageor.</p>
