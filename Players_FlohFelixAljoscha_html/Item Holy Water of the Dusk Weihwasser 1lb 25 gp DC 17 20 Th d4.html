<p>Symbaroum This water, instilled with the light of Prios, can heal
wounds and sooth souls. It heals 2d4 + 2 hit points and reduces

creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it

silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>

belong to the Abomination monster category suffers 1D10+10 damage. Of
course, this also affects the one who carries the vial.<br />

to it ever becomes blight-marked, then the vial will detonate with the
same effect as Justice of the Lightbringer.</p>
