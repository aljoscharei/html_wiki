<p>During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica
took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby
brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted
off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of
a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual
proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and
transfer it to the soul in the stone.</p>
<p>With the first casting, the mystic uses a soul stone (see page 185)
worth at least 100 thaler and a creature that dies as a result of the
spell. The creature must have less than 10 hit points at the time you
begin to cast the spell. At the end of the spell, the creature dies, and
the spell collects the soul of the dying creature, turning the gem into
a soul stone. Roll 2d4 and add your spellcasting modifier; this is the
amount of permanent Corruption that the soul stone can hold.</p>
<p>Subsequent castings allow the mystic to move 1d4 points of permanent
Corruption to the soul stone. The soul stone darkens as it fills up and
detonates if its limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then
rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result.</p>
<p>You can only use a single soul stone at a time and cannot create a
new one while an old one exists.</p>
