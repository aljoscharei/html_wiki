<h1 >Secret Chest</h1>
<p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2
feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp,
and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50
gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You
must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material
component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of
nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).<br />
While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and
touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space
on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the
Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the
replica.<br />
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the
spellâ€™s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if
the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the
spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the
Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.</p>
