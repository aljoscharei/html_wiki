<h1 >total cover</h1>
<p>A target with <strong><a href="total%20cover.html">total
cover</a></strong> canâ€™t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell,
although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area
of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an
obstacle.</p>
