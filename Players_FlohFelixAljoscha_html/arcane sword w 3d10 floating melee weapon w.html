<p>Have you ever found yourself in an adventuring party with a cleric,
and you get really jealous of their <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/spiritual-weapon">Spriritual
Weapon</a>? You might think to yourself, “ I wish I could have a
floating weapon to hit stuff with! If only there was a way I could do
the same thing!” Well, you’re in luck; let me introduce you to a spell
worse in every conceivable way: Arcane Sword!</p>
<p>Arcane Sword is exclusive to Bards and Wizards. It creates a
sword-like force you can fly around and stab things with as a bonus
action. One small hiccup though; it’s a <strong>7TH LEVEL
SPELL</strong>.</p>
<p>For that spell level this sword best be vorpal, invulnerable, cook
you dinner, and pay off your mortgage.</p>
<p>What else could be in store beyond the reach of the simple 2nd level
cleric spell, spiritual weapon? There would have to be something nuts to
make it 7th level, right?</p>
<p>Nope. It is nearly strictly worse than its 2nd level cleric
counterpart. You can cast Spiritual Weapon as a bonus action; Arcane
Sword costs an action. Both make an attack on summon. Arcane Sword
requires concentration, where Spiritual Weapon does not. They both move
up to 20 feet, and are summoned within 60 feet of the caster. Spiritual
Weapon flexibly costs a 2nd, 4th, 6th, or 8th level slot, all with
up-casting benefits; Arcane Sword can only ever be cast at 7th level or
higher with no upsides for up-casting it.</p>
<p>The only slight benefit over its cleric counterpart is the round you
cast Arcane Sword you can use your bonus action to make a second attack
with it, but this “extra attack” is competing with the action spiritual
weapon users are getting to cast a cantrip, make a weapon attack, or
just take a useful action like dashing or dodging.</p>
<p>Spiritual Weapon, when cast with just a 6th level spell, does 3d8
<strong>+ spellcasting modifier</strong> damage whereas Arcane sword is
doing 3d10; if the spellcasting ability modifier is just a +3 they both
do an average of 16.5 damage per hit. Any higher mods causes Spiritual
Weapon to have a higher average damage per hit at a lower spell level
than Arcane Sword.</p>
<p>Spiritual Weapon doesn’t just make Arcane Sword look bad; it
embarasses Arcane Sword in front of the entire school to the point where
Arcane Sword can’t look its peers in the eyes ever again.</p>
<p>If you want to take Arcane Sword for the thematics of a spectral
blade at your command may I instead recommend <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/animate-objects">Animate
Objects</a>. At two spell levels lower in the same classes you can be
attacking with a fleet of small or medium blades every round for the
same duration, nearly always dealing substantially more damage.</p>
<p>If half the attacks hit with the smallest weapons you’ll be dealing
5d4+20 damage, or an average of 32.5 damage per round with just your
bonus action. If you up-cast it to 7th level add in another four attacks
for 14 weapons attacking for potentially 14d4+20 (55) damage. Just carry
a couple sets of chef’s knives with you and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>If the sword part doesn’t matter much to you, and you don’t want the
hassle of managing a fleet of objects, consider instead <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/arcane-hand">Arcane
Hand</a>. It’s only a 5th level spell that deals 4d8 (18 average) damage
that can be up-cast to deal 8d8 (36 average) damage as a 7th level spell
each round that can move further, has additional modes of use, and even
makes spiritual weapon look bad!</p>
<p>Where I think you could find the most success with Arcane Sword would
be with a high level College of Swords bard or a Bladesinger Wizard
purely for thematic reasons, but in both cases by 13th level I imagine
your bonus action already being solidly in use making off-hand
attacks.</p>
<p>An Abjurer wizard might want something like this for the flavor, but
I really can’t recommend it over most of the other competing options for
your concentration.</p>
