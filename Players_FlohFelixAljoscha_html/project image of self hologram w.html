<p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 500 miles<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small replica of you made from
materials worth at least 5 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 day</p>
<p>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration.
The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen
before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and
sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it
disappears, and the spell ends.<br />
You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed,
and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It
mimics your mannerisms perfectly.<br />
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in
its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its
senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.<br />
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
creature.</p>

<p>Picture this; you’re a super villain ruling over thousands of
minions. You’re up on your balcony, looking down over the intrepid
heroes who have invaded your keep. This is the final confrontation, you
can feel it, your perfect moment to come clean and share the true master
villainy you’re capable of through a beautifully crafted speech. Then
the dickhead sharpshooter ranger opens fire and hits you for 72 damage.
Why put yourself in range, when you could instead just Project Image and
monolog from the safety of your secret lair living room couch?</p>
<p>Project Image falls under the category of spells where I’m glad it
exists, but unfortunately just is too niche to be good in the players’
hands. Sure, if you’re campaigning in the British Isles you can project
your image literally anywhere within the country, but the practical uses
of this project require so much micromanagement and awkward dealings it
becomes kind of impossible to use functionally. In the real world, we
basically already have this. Its called work from home. In D&amp;D,
there isn’t really any “benefit” to your character to do this, save if
you need to do some long distance communication or scouting. In either
case, Find Familiar will just be better than this, as you don’t need to
constantly sink actions into your illusory clone to get it to act on
your behalf, plus you can physically manipulate space. Sure, you can’t
instantaneously teleport your familiar back and forth, but leaving it
behind if you desperately need to can functionally mimic this 7th level
spell without even needing to spend a 1st level slot.</p>
<p>From a villainous and world building perspective, Project Image is
great. Having an archmage communicating with officials across the world
through Project Image allows for some incredible options to detail the
world. It’s like living in the modern era of communication, but only the
top 0.01% of computer scientists could use cell phones to talk to
anyone. You can have instantaneous information, and the functionally
ability to observe disasters and invasions from hundreds of miles away.
Networks of people with Project Images could pass instantaneous messages
for hefty fees, creating giant towers to communicate across the entire
plane.</p>
<p>Having your villain Project Image to taunt and speak with the party
gives you the perfect tool to negotiate with players without necessarily
threatening either side. You can “safely” communicate threats, offers,
or other critical information without needing to physically present the
villain. They too can then use this tool to manipulate kingdoms hundreds
of miles apart and act as a shadowy puppet master from the darkness
capable of controlling huge territories without physically needing to be
present in any given location.</p>
<p>From a player perspective, Project Image is probably one of the worst
illusions <a

href="mirage%20arcane%20all%20sense%20terrain%20w.html">mirage arcane all
sense terrain w</a> , and even <a href="silent%20image%20w.html">silent
image w</a> all can create copies of yourself to work with, and can do
the creative illusionist game breaking stuff for less. Project Image
then requires you want the distance to matter, and while there can be
some niche cases where it’ll be helpful for your party, its really best
saved for NPCs and villains.</p>
