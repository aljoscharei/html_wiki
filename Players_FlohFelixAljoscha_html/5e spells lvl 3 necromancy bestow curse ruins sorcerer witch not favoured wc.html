<h1 >Bestow Curse</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you
cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following
options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage
on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li>
<li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against
you.</li>
<li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the
start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn
doing nothing.</li>
<li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra
1d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="remove_curse%20wc%20not%20favoured.html">remove_curse wc not
favoured</a> spell ends this effect. At the GM’s option, you may choose
an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than
those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse’s
effect.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to
10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration
is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration
is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it
is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a
duration that doesn’t require concentration.</p>
