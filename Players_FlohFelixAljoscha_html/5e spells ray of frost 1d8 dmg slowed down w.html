<p>A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within
range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes
1d8 cold damage, and its <strong>speed is reduced by 10 feet</strong>
until the start of your next turn.<br />
The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<p>dscryb A chill runs down the length of your arm and emerges as a
blue-white ray extending from your fingertip, emitting a crackling sound
exactly like a frozen lake trod upon in the dead of winter.</p>
