<p>Training</p>
<p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or
training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training
options. First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM
determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are
required. The training lasts for <strong>250 days</strong> and costs 1
thaler per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>
