<p>This rainbow-shimmering cloak of lindworm skin is said to come from a
serpent slain near the Columns of Haganor, at the time when the columns
still sparkled with gold and silver. The cloak still holds some mystical
powers – it can lend the mas- ter a voice which enthralls the listener
like the hypnotic powers of a lindworm; or a commanding, thundering
voice turning even the most resilient of warriors into an obedient
slave.</p>
<p>The Haganor Skin also comes with a negative effect: if a living
lindworm sees the cloak it will remember the humiliating times when
Symbaroum’s princes hunted its ancestors for amusement, and immediately
– on behalf of all proud lindworms – choose the master of the skin as
its personal nemesis. In this context it should be mentioned that all
lindworms are immune to the powers of the skin.</p>

<p>The skin’s master can let its voice play at the strings of the soul.

<p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the wearers Charisma
Ability Score + the wearers Proficiency Bonus or be <a
href="202202102000%205e%20Conditions%20Charmed.html">202202102000 5e
Conditions Charmed</a> by you for the duration. If you or creatures that
are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving
throw.<br />
While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long
as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this
telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are
conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can
specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that
creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature
completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it
defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use
your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the
end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose,
and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time
you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you
to use your own reaction as well.<br />
At the End of each Turn and each time the target takes damage, it makes
a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw
succeeds, the effect ends. The Effect requires <a
