symbaroum Hunter Approach Bounty Hunter</h1>
<p>During The Great War there were deserters – many doubted that a
victory over the Dark Lords was possible. To deal with the problem, King
Ynedar, Queen Korinthia’s father, placed a permanent bounty on the heads
of the runaways. In doing so, he indirectly founded the guild of the
Bounty Hunters. The tradition to pay for having fugitives caught lives
on and nowadays the bounty hunters are often forced to venture into the
forest of Davokar, where the most desperate – and also most valuable –
targets tend to seek refuge.</p>
