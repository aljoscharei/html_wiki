<h1 >Programmed Illusion</h1>
<p><em>6th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust
worth at least 25 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other
visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition
occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger
than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the
illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can
last up to 5 minutes.<br />
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into
existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion
finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes.
After this time, the illusion can be activated again.<br />
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like,
though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur
within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of
yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped
door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says
the correct word or phrase.<br />
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
creature.</p>

<p>Can this illusion move around or is it stuck in the hex you create it
on? :)</p>
<p>Personally I’d say yes; the spell only states that the illusory
object/creature/phenomenon must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, but it
can behave how you like.</p>
<p>To me that means you could set a trigger for enemies approaching
within 30-feet of a cave entrance, causing a dragon to appear (just out
of sight) then fly from the cave roaring and flying around in an arc
like it’s going to make a pass and return, hopefully scaring away the
intruders who’ll think they’re about to be a dragon’s dinner if they
don’t make themselves scarce.</p>
<p>Only restriction is the amount of time the illusion lasts, so
something moving at a realistic speed can only travel so far, also the
fact the illusion will be broken if it passes through something (though
if you make it look like a ghost that might not be a problem). Also the
trigger must be within 30-feet of the starting point, so no matter how
far it can move it must start from and be triggered there.</p>
<p>What I love most is the fact that this spell’s duration is “until
dispelled”; my Bard tavern owner is 100% going to cast this every day to
create annoying greeters outside the bar, chaining the trigger
conditions together to bypass the 10-minute downtime (if the first
casting is on cooldown, the second will trigger instead etc.).</p>
