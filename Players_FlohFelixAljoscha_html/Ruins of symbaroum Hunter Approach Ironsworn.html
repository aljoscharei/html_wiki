<h1 >Ruins of symbaroum
Hunter Approach Ironsworn</h1>
<p>Ironsworn</p>
<p>The work of the Iron Pact is never done, which places great demands
on its agents, the Ironsworn. The pact was created by elves at the time
of Symbaroum’s downfall, and after a long time in the shadows its
members are on the move again, trying to stop the spreading darkness.
Davokar must never awaken, and it won’t, if the Ironsworn can help
it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the Iron Pact recruits new agents from all origins and
cultures; anyone sympathetic to the struggle is test- ed in a series of
both physical and moral challenges. Those who make it with both life and
loyalty intact are invited to swear the Iron Oath. After that follows a
time of training and further testing before initiates become true
members of the Pact – agents devoted to the fight against
Corruption.</p>
