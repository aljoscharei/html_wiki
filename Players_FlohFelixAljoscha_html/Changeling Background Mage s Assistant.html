<h1 >Changeling Background

and rejection as they grow up, but at the first signs of your inner
nature a mystic visited your family and con- vinced them to allow you to
apprentice with them. Fascinated by your magical nature, you are well
treated by your tutor, or at least better than you would be in your home
village.<br />

<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>Though most of your training time was spent inside, away from curious
eyes, you are still awkward when meeting others or trying to convince
them of your sincerity and dedication.</p>
<p>Personality 1. I seek out the company of mystics whenever I can. 2. I
keep my knowledge to myself, unless it’s needed for survival. 3. If a
problem can be solved by using magic, I will use magic. 4. I talk too
loud and stand too close to people when I do it. Feels perfectly normal
to me. 5. I chose the opposing view in discussions, just to make it more
interesting. 6. I share my magical insights with everyone, whether they
ask for it or not. 7. I am careful to only use magic when it is really
needed, preferring mundane methods if at all possible. 8. I can’t keep
my mind on the topic at hand, I always find a more interesting tangent
to explore. Ideal 1. Study. Nothing about my personal history matters,
only learning more magic. 2. Fight fire with fire. Corruption is a gift,
we must use it to win. 3. Common good. Magic should be used to better
society for all. 4. Purity. I must keep my body and soul free from
Corruption. 5. Power. With enough magic I can do whatever I want, and no
one can stop me. 6. Legacy. I will transmit all I have learned to the
next generation. Bond 1. The mystic who brought me here saved my life.
2. I carry something from my childhood, to remind me of simpler days. 3.
I have a tome of study that I always keep within me – it changed my
whole worldview. 4. I feel a calling towards the forest, despite my
fears. 5. I feel a connection with magic itself, more important than any
person. 6. I remember my ‘sibling’ weeping when my nature was
discovered. I keep that memory forever. Flaw 1. I deserve an explanation
for my life, even if it must be written in blood. 2. I am caught between
human and elven ways and will never feel at home. 3. I want to grow so
strong in magic that no one dares question me. 4. I know magic will be
the end of me, but I can’t stop longing for more of it. 5. When people
call me names, I am tempted to believe them. 6. I am superior to
humanity and that is why they are afraid of me.</p>
