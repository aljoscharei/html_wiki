<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or
some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this
extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you
cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure,
you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest.
While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other
creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A <a

c not favoured</a> spell cast on you ends this effect.<br />
On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each
question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,”
“irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the
question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might
instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>
