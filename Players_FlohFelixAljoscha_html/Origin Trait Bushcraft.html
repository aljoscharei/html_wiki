<h1 >Origin Trait Bushcraft</h1>
<p>You can survive on meager resources and are used to finding food and
shelter in harsh terrain. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)
check, the character can find enough food and water to feed themself
while being on the move in the wilderness or among Davokarâ€™s ruins. If
the character is part of a small group (up to five individuals), food
and water can be found for them as well (increase the DC for the check
by one for each additional person other than yourself ), but that will
take much longer. The group cannot be on the move during that time.</p>
