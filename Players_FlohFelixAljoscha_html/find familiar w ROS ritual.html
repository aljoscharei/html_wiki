<h1 >Find Familiar</h1>
<p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense,
and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal
form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus,
owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or
weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has
the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or
fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.<br />
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your
commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own
turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as
normal.<br />
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind
no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.<br />
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with
it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your
familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next
turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has.
During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own
senses.<br />
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears
into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you
can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed,
you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of
you.<br />
You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell
while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new
form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar
transforms into the chosen creature.<br />
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can
deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be
within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the
spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use
your attack modifier for the roll.</p>
