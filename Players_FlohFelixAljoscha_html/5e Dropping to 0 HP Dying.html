<h1 >5e Dropping to 0 HP Dying</h1>
<h2 >Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h2>
<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall
unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>
<h3 >Instant Death</h3>
<p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0
hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining
damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>
<p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6
hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0
hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals
her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p>
<h3 >Falling Unconscious</h3>
<p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall
unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p>
<h3 >Death Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a
special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether
you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,
this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.</p>
<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you
fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third
success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of
both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to
zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling 1 or 20.</strong> When you make a death saving throw
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on
the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</strong> If you take any damage while
you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the
damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the
damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant
death.</p>

<h3 >Monsters and Death</h3>
<p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points,
rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p>
<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common
exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same
rules as player characters.</p>

<h1 >Death Saving
Throws in DnD 5e – A Guide to Not Dying</h1>
<hr />
<p>Otherwise, let’s get started. </p>
<p>“The <a
href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/kobold-race-guide-5e/">kobold</a>
swings its knife at you and…” The DM winces. “It crits. Ok…” She rolls
2d4 and adds 2. She winces again. “You take, uh, 10 points of piercing
damage.”</p>
<p>The Wizard falls to the ground, blood spreading from a grievous wound
in his chest. His eyes close. This was supposed to be an easy job. A
walk in the park. One poorly planned rescue attempt and a few unlucky
rolls later, and now the Wizard <em>and</em> the Rogue are
unconscious.</p>
<p>The Fighter (who has no healing abilities and a -1 to Medicine
checks) is surrounded. The Rogue asks, “So, are we dead?” </p>
<p>Well, maybe. </p>
<p>In <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em>, dropping to or below 0 hit
points isn’t necessarily the end of the line. </p>
<p>While it’s unlikely that a higher level character will get downed
outside of a climactic boss fight, lower level <em>D&amp;D</em> can feel
much more like a survival horror game than heroic fantasy, as characters
with fewer than 10 hit maximum points grapple with all manner of nasty
dungeon dwellers, fiendish traps, and knife-wielding bandits. </p>
<p>What happens when a player character drops to 0 hit points or below?
It’s time for one of two things to happen. </p>
<p>First of all, <strong>if the damage you take is enough to bring you
far enough below 0 hit points to exceed your maximum HP, you die
outright</strong>. For example, if a character with a max HP of 10 is at
2 HP and takes 13 points of damage, their hit points are reduced to -11
HP, killing them instantly. </p>
<p>There are also a few spells, like <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/power-word-kill">Power Word
Kill</a>, which can cause instant, inescapable death. </p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, it’s time to start rolling death
saves.</strong> </p>
<h2 ><strong>How to Make a Death
Saving Throw</strong> </h2>
<p>When your character drops to 0 hit points but doesn’t die, they fall
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious">unconscious</a>.
This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points. </p>
<p>Whenever you begin a turn in combat with 0 hit points or fewer, the
DM will call on you to make a death saving throw. This special type of
save determines whether your character inches closer to permanent death
or hangs onto life. </p>
<p>Unlike other checks and saving throws, you don’t apply your modifiers
to a death save. </p>
<p><strong>Roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you succeed, taking one more
step towards the light. On a 1-9, you fail, and the darkness tightens
its grip on you.</strong> </p>
<p>If you begin your next turn with 0 hit points, you make another
saving throw. </p>
<p>If you accumulate three successful death saving throws before you
accumulate three failures, your character is no longer in danger of
dying and becomes stable.</p>
<p>A stable character remains unconscious at 0 hit points, unless it
takes any more damage or is healed, and will regain consciousness and 1
hitpoint after 1d4 hours. </p>
<p>When you become stable or return to consciousness, all your failed
and successful death saves reset. </p>
<p>If you accumulate three failed death saves, your character shuffles
off their mortal coil and is truly dead. Turn in your character
sheet. </p>
<p>You don’t need to make successful or failed death saves
consecutively; you just need to reach three of one result over, at the
most, six rolls.  </p>
<p>However, in the frantic melee of a D&amp;D combat, things are rarely
that simple. </p>
<h2 ><strong>Crits, Fumbles, and
other Concerns</strong> </h2>
<p>There are a few special rules that can affect the outcome of death
saving throws. </p>
<p><strong>Crits.</strong> If you roll a natural 20 on a death saving
throw, your character surges back to consciousness. You immediately
regain 1 hit point and can act again as normal – although the first
thing you may want to do is to crawl away while trying to look as
inconspicuous as possible. </p>
<p><a
href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/fumble-charts-5e/"><strong>Fumbles.</strong></a>If
you roll a 1 on a death saving throw, you mark two failures instead of
one. </p>
<p><strong>Taking Damage at 0 Hit Points</strong>. If you take any
damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw
failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures
instead.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that, in 5e, any melee attack that hits an
unconscious or incapacitated target is made at advantage and, if it
hits, is an automatic critical. If the damage you suffer equals or
exceeds your hit point maximum, you die instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Medicine Checks.</strong> If no one has access to healing
spells, any player can attempt to stabilize a dying character by making
a Medicine check with a DC of 10. </p>
<p><strong>Death Saves Outside of Combat.</strong> There are no specific
rules for making death saves outside of the initiative order, although
you can try the following… </p>
<p>If a player drops to 0 hit points outside of combat, you can roll
initiative and have the players act in turn, making death saves,
medicine checks, and casting healing spells until the player regains
consciousness or dies.</p>
<p>This can be a slow process and, if there’s a healer in the party,
it’s impossible (even if the dying player rolls a natural 1) that they
would fail enough saves before being healed.</p>
<p>The alternative is that, if the party has no healing abilities, the
player with the highest Medicine proficiency can make a check (at
advantage if another player with proficiency helps them).</p>
<p>If that check fails, the dying player makes death saving throws in
quick succession until one result is reached. </p>
<h2 ><strong>Spells and
Abilities</strong> </h2>
<p>From healing charms to instant-kill curses, there are a number of
abilities, feats, and spells that can affect the outcome of a player
dropping to 0 hit points. We’ve broken down how some of these features
interact with death saves below. </p>
<h3 ><a
href="5e%20spells%20spare%20the%20dying%20stabilize%20c.html">5e spells

<p><strong>Level:</strong> Cantrip</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Cast Time:</strong> 1 Action</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>School:</strong> Necromancy </p>
<p><strong>Classes:</strong> Cleric, Artificer</p>
<p>_You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature
becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs</p>
<p>This cantrip can be – quite literally – a life saver. The value of
being able to have your party’s healer negate the need for death saving
throws altogether (assuming they can get close enough to touch the dying
party member) is immense.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that Spare the Dying won’t bring a downed party
member back into the fight, just prevent them from succumbing to their
injuries. Having this cantrip in your back pocket, however, makes for a
fantastic last resort. </p>
<h3 ><a href="paladin#Lay%20on%20Hands"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Paladin </p>
<p><strong>HP Pool:</strong> 5 x Paladin Level </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p><em>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the
pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the
maximum amount remaining in your pool.</em></p>
<p>A lot of inexperienced players are wont to throw out their entire Lay
on Hands HP pool in a single big heal.</p>
<p>However, the true value of this class feature is that you can
dispense as little as 1 HP at a time, meaning that a 1st level <a
href="paladin">paladin</a> can potentially bring a dying player back
into the fight five times. A 2nd level Paladin can do this ten times!
Just make sure you can actually get to your downed ally in time. </p>
<h3 ><a
href="GM_FlohFelixAljoscha/5e%20SRD/bard#Bardic%20Inspiration"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Bard </p>
<p><strong>Die Size:</strong> d6 at 1st level. The die becomes a d8 at
5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>
<p><strong>Cast Time:</strong> Bonus Action </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 Minutes</p>
<p><em>As a bonus action, choose one creature other than yourself within
60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
Inspiration die, a d6.</em></p>
<p><em>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die
and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving
throw it makes.</em> </p>
<p>There aren’t many ways to affect the results of a death saving throw,
but Bardic Inspiration (due to the fact the rules state it can be used
on <em>any</em> saving throw) is one of them.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that because granting Bardic Inspiration
needs the recipient to be able to hear the Bard granting it, a downed
character must have already had an unused Bardic Inspiration die before
they were reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<p>Some DMs rule that being dropped to 0 hit points doesn’t render you
unconscious, merely unable to move, in which case that character could
still receive bardic inspiration. </p>

<p><em>Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within

<p>Like the cruel mirror to Bardic Inspiration, <a
href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/spells/bane-5e/">Bane</a> causes you
to subtract 1d4 from all saving throws (including death saves) for a
minute. Watch out for this nasty spell – a favorite of necromancers and
evil mages everywhere. </p>
<h3 ><a

<p><strong>Cast Time:</strong> 1 Action</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>School:</strong> Enchantment </p>
<p><strong>Classes:</strong> Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>
<p><em>You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can

hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no
effect.</em></p>
<p>This is one of the most devastating spells in a BBEG’s arsenal, and
can make for a truly gut-wrenching moment if a DM decides to pull it
out. Unless your party’s spellcaster has a sufficiently beefy
Counterspell up their sleeve, someone with fewer than 100 hit points is
going to die and there is <em>nothing</em> you can do about it.</p>
<p>You have been warned. </p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the <a
href="5e%20spells%20disintegrate10d6plus40%20dmg%20w.html">5e spells
disintegrate10d6plus40 dmg w</a> spell also kills you outright if it
reduces you to 0 HP. </p>
<h3 ><a href="5e%20feats.md#Lucky"></a></h3>
<p><em>You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the
right moment.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an
ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll
an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after
you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which
of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw.</em></li>
<li><em>You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made
against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the
attacker’s roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point
to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no
additional dice are rolled.</em></li>
<li><em>You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long
rest.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Like with <a
href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/bardic-inspiration-5e/">Bardic
Inspiration</a>, anything that lets you affect the outcome of a saving
throw also applies to death saves. The other cool thing with this feat
is that it lets you reroll an attacker’s d20 roll as well. Keeping in
mind that, if you’re unconscious, attacks made against you have
advantage and automatically crit, being able to make it a little harder
for a goblin to gut you where you lie is no bad thing. </p>
<h2 ><strong>Common
Questions About Death Saving Throws</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Is a Death Saving Throw an Action?</strong></p>
<p>No. Even though you make a death saving throw on your turn, it is not
an action. The Incapacitated condition in the Player’s Handbook states
that “An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions,” so
it’s technically impossible for death saves to be actions.</p>
<p>This does mean, therefore, that if you roll a 20 and jump back up to
1 hit point, you can take an action – although you begin your turn prone
and must spend movement to stand up. </p>
<p><strong>Do successful and failed death saves carry over?</strong></p>
<p>If you become stable, get healed, or roll a natural 20 on a death
save, all of your death saves are reset (successes and failures). When
you roll a 20 on your death saving throw, you become conscious and
regain 1 HP.</p>
<p><strong>Do monsters make death saving throws?</strong></p>
<p>No. When a monster, enemy, or NPC drops to 0 hit points, they die
instantly unless the attacking player already declared non-lethal
damage. However, there’s nothing to stop a DM from implementing death
saving rules to make a particularly dangerous monster or boss feel
special.</p>
<h2 >Alternative Rule for Death
saves</h2>
<h3 >A Modest
Proposal: House-Rule to D&amp;D 5e Death Saves</h3>
<p><strong>Players at my 5e table initially reacted with horror when a
character fell to zero hit points, but soon learned that it carried
little risk after the first few times it happened. Rather than rushing
to immediately help the fallen character, the players learned they
likely had at least two rounds before any real risk raised its head. In
sum, the rules-as-written provided tension only when a character failed
two death saving throws, not when they fell to zero hit
points.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, I implemented a simple house rule. Rather than roll a d20
for a death saving throw, characters roll their Hit Die. A result of 2
or greater counts as a success. If they roll a 1, they die.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They still stabilize if they make three successful saves, but
now they have a risk of dying each turn they remain
“dying.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ll admit it’s a big deal, to tinker with the rules
surrounding character death. Depending on the attitude at your table,
character death might be a serious thing. So, you’re probably wondering:
How does this house rule affect the probability of characters dying when
they fall unconscious?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, it actually makes them <em>slightly more likely
to survive</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When a character in Fifth Edition falls to 0hp, they
have</strong> <a
href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/76958/what-is-the-probability-of-surviving-my-death-saves">about
a base 60% chance of stabilizing on their own,</a> <strong>not counting
other characters healing or aiding them.</strong></p>
<p>I used <a href="https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1223626305">this
online calculator</a> to find the probability of a character passing
three death saves using my house rule, stabilizing after three
successes. I found the likelihood for each Hit Die, from a d6 to a d12.
(I’ll admit I’m not fluent in probability, so if someone notices a
mistake in interpreting these results - please let me know!)</p>
<p>If you implement my house rule as exactly as described, magic-users
have about the same chance of dying, while everyone else becomes less
likely to die. If you harden my rule so that characters  die on a Death
Saving Throw of a 1 or a <em>2</em>, everyone becomes <em>more</em>
likely to die <em>except</em> Barbarians.</p>

<p>*P.S. I’m not very well-versed in probability – so if you see
something I miscalculated in the table above, please let me know so I
can correct it.</p>
<p>Also, to pre-empt the question of how to handle characters who take
damage while lying unconscious and dying: currently, I rule that such a
character must make another death saving throw each time they take
damage while unconscious – still dying on a result of a 1. Instant Death
also works the same way if the damage exceeds their hit point
maximum.</p>
<p>Obviously, character death and its role at your table is something to
think long and hard about as a GM. I wouldn’t implement the above house
rule lightly. However, I’ve found that using this system in my
house-rule table makes it much more dramatic when characters fall in
battle. The other players react by immediately planning on how to get
the “downed” character back to their feet – or stabilized, at the least
– as soon as possible. They know that, if a turn passes and that
character rolls a death save, there is a chance, however small, that the
character will breathe their last.</p>
<p>Some Game Masters might balk at the idea that, once a character falls
unconscious, they could die with a single roll. However, I believe that
characters usually fall unconscious as a result of poor choices, poor
luck, or some combination of both. Often, a lot of decisions and rolls
lead up to a character falling unconscious and making a death saving
throw. So I would argue that, with this house rule, a single roll
doesn’t have the power to kill a character. They still fall unconscious
when hit by an attack before dying, and their allies still have a whole
round to help them. The benefit is that, in my experience, this house
rule encourages players to make less decisions that lead
unconsciousness, as the risks of doing so are higher.</p>
<p>If you try this house rule in your own game or have your own
suggestions, please let me know how it goes!</p>
