<h1 >Item Spark Stone 50 Th</h1>
<p>The power of a pyromancer is increased by this glowing amber. The
spark stone is a weaker version of the renowned sun stones that the
master pyromancers of old could craft from summoned fire spirits.
Nowadays, the fire wizards have to make do with lesser artifacts, not as
powerful but still a great help to those whose skills relate to fire and
burning. A pyromancer with a spark stone can reroll any fire damage dice
that show a ‘1’ for a single spell. The stone must then be recharged
with a long or extended rest.</p>
