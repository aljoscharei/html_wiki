<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (three nut shells)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions
and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.<br />
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start
of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>

This spell disorders (p. 13) one unit within 2 hexes of the caster.
Units with 2 HD or more may avoid the effects with a saving throw versus
Spells. Otherwise, the unit remains disordered for 12 combat rounds or
until dispelled. The unit may not be activated during this time.</p>

<p>This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30’ radius
circle around the target point to become confused, making them unable to
independently determine what they will do. Creatures with 2 or fewer Hit
Dice receive no saving throw. Those with more than 2 Hit Dice may make a
saving throw versus Spells to resist the effect. A confused creature
rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative each round to
determine its actions:</p>

<p>A confused creature which can’t carry out the indicated action does
nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special
advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature who
is attacked automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is
still confused when its turn comes.</p>
