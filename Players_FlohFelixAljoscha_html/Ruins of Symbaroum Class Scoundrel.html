<p>approach</p>
<p>At first level you also choose your approach, the way that your
scoundrel interacts with the world: are they an Explorer, a Spy, a
Treasure-hunter, a Thug, or a Sapper? Each approach deals with
subterfuge and a careful approach to problems, but they typically find
themselves in different environments with drastically different
foes.</p>
<p>Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th and 17th
levels.</p>
