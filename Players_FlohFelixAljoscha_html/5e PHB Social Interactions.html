<h1 >5e PHB Social Interactions</h1>
<p>Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are
key parts of D&amp;D adventures. No less important, though, are the
social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the
world.</p>
<p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an
unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to
flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the
roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that
don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is
called a <strong>nonplayer character</strong> (NPC).</p>
<p>In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as
friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help
you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to
get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.</p>
<p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability
checks.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#Roleplaying"></a>Roleplaying</h3>
<p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this
case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts,
and talks.</p>
<p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to
the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks,
mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p>
<p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the
descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a
combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best
for you.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#DescriptiveApproachtoRoleplaying"></a>Descriptive
Approach to Roleplaying</h4>
<p>With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions
to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your
character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she
does it.</p>
<p>For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper
and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a
tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to
strike up a conversation with the dwarf.</p>
<p>Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard,
and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the
minstrel before ordering another drink.”</p>
<p>In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a
clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.</p>
<p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in
mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li>
<li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive
it.</li>
<li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on
thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see
in your mind.</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#ActiveApproachtoRoleplaying"></a>Active
Approach to Roleplaying</h4>
<p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what
your character thinks and does, active roleplaying <em>shows</em>
them.</p>
<p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s
voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your
character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive
than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things
that can’t be reasonably acted out.</p>
<p>Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s
how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p>
<p>Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was
wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear
anything out of you, I’d snap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his
normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to
the bar.”</p>
<h4 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#ResultsofRoleplaying"></a>Results
of Roleplaying</h4>
<p>The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how
an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A
stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up
flattery.</p>
<p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s
portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be
able to determine an NPC’s <a

traits</a>, <a

and <a

then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.</p>
<p>Interactions in D&amp;D are much like interactions in real life. If
you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something
they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to
get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud
warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or
deceive will fall short.</p>
<h3 ><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#AbilityChecks"></a>Ability
Checks</h3>
<p>In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the
outcome of an interaction.</p>
<p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might
still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can
call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or
she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions.
Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s
discretion.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you
want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using
an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group
needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is
proficient in <a

is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s
release, the cleric with <a

should do most of the talking.</p>
