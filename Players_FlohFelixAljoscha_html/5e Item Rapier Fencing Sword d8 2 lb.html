<p>Fencing Sword. In Yndaros, the Ambrian fencing sword is considered to
be of the highest fashion, an instrument with superior precision made
from strong but flexible steel. It is often combined with the duelistâ€™s
favorite, the parrying dagger, which gives the lightly armored fighter a
stronger defense in combat.</p>
