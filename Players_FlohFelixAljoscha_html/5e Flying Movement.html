<h1 >5e Flying Movement</h1>
<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also
deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked <a
href="prone.html">Prone</a>, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise
deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the
ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the
<strong><em>fly</em></strong> spell. <a
