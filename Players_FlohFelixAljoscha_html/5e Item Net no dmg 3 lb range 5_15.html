<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is <a
href="Restrained.html">Restrained</a> until it is freed. A net has no
effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or
larger.</p>
<p>A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing
itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5
slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without
harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an
action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make
only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally
make. no dmg | 3 lb. | <a
href="Weapon%20Properties%205e%20Special.html">Weapon Properties 5e
Special</a>, <a href="Weapon%20Properties%205e%20Thrown.html">Weapon
Properties 5e Thrown</a> (range 5/15)</p>
<p>So nets are very easy to escape from DC10 so the trick is to have the
target covered in at least two nets so that the target is restrained
even if it uses its turn to free itself from one net</p>
