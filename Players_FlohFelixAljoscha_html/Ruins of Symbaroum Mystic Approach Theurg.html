<p>Corruption</p>
<ul>
<li>The theurgs of Prios teach that <strong>Corruption occurs when
nature is allowed to grow without being cultivated and tamed</strong>.
Corruption thrives in the wild, in chaos, that which is uncontrolled by
humans – and in their encounters with Davokar they seem to find all the
evidence needed to support this interpretation of the world order.
<ul>
<li>DAS MACHT KEINEN SINN IM KRIEG IN ALBERETOR. DA GAB ES KEINEN
DUNKLEN WALD. DUNKELHEIT IM HERZEN?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Every devotee of Prios must accept the threat of Corruption and keep
their inner flame burning despite the risk of taint; just as the
Lightbringer Ofelya Attio is said to have proclaimed while standing at
the threshold of the Dark Lords’ stronghold: “Fire shall with fire be
fought, darkness shall with darkness be vanquished!”</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>Theurgs rely on the teachings of the Sun God when interpreting his
teachings or calling upon his power. They use Wisdom as their
spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells from the Theurg
tradition list. THEY PREY TO THE LIGHTBRINGERS OR SAINTS TO GRANT THEM
POWER.</p>

<p>Matter of Faith</p>
<p>When you reach 17th level, choose one of your ritual spells. Remove
permanent Corruption equal to half its spell level, rounded up. This
spell no longer weighs on your soul, since you have internalized its
power as being provided solely by Prios.</p>
