<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 30 days</p>
<p>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within
range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action
or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you,
it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for
the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10
psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t
understand you is unaffected by the spell.<br />
You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would
result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell
ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A <a
