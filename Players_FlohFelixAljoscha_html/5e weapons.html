<p>description: Rules and information about different weapon types and
properties from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference
Document).</p>
<h1 >Weapons</h1>
<p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the
classâ€™s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you
favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it
effectively can mean the difference between life and death while
adventuring.</p>
<p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy
gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they
hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified
as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target
within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target
at a distance.</p>

<h2 >Silvered Weapons</h2>
<p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons
are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra
coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon
or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only
the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver
to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>
