<h1 >Goblin Backgrounds Wild</h1>
<p>While many goblins have found themselves under the thumb of the
newcomers, you and your clan have stayed away from both the Ambrians and
barbarians by staying in the darker parts of Davokar. But the forest is
changing, and the trolls and elves whisper that the humans have
something to do with it. You’ve decided to explore these ideas but are
also cautious about who you befriend, since you have no desire to become
a laborer.</p>

<p>Suggested Characteristics You are a goblin as they should have always
been: wild and free and able to do anything you wish. Of course, you
sometimes see your cousins in the human cities, with their fancy
clothes, weapons and flashing coins…</p>
<p>Personality 1. I am now realizing that the world is much bigger than
I thought. 2. I will become a troll someday, so you better treat me with
respect. 3. I want to know what is important but everyone has a
different answer. 4. I have a pet that I talk to, what’s weird about
that? 5. I think that being free is the best way to be and will share
that with everyone. 6. I only have a few years to experience everything,
so let’s go. 7. I invite others to play goblin games, but almost nobody
wants to join in. 8. I cast bones to help me make decisions. They’re my
uncle’s bones, very wise goblin he was.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Fear. If you’re scared of everything you are always
cautious. 2. Nature. Nothing built by people compares to the truly wild
places of the world. 3. Chaos. Randomness favors the underdog, so I
maximize chaos wherever I can. 4. Wonder. Learn something new every day
or you have wasted your time. 5. Might makes right. I have learned the
lesson well, and soon it’s my turn. 6. Greed. What better legacy than a
golden statue of the greatest goblin that ever lived?</p>
<p>Bond 1. I keep a vision in my head of my little nook in the forest.
I’m going back there someday. 2. I am convinced the gods love me, and I
will not let them down. 3. Someone saved my bony behind and I am forever
in that person’s debt. 4. I made a promise and I will keep that promise,
no matter how foolish others think me. 5. I swore to lead my people to a
better place, and this I will do. 6. I have an animal that I love, and
will always protect.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. No one that knows me would confuse me for being civilized. At
all. 2. Eating the hearts of my enemies will make me live longer. 3.
Dressing like powerful people will make me more like them. 4. I crave
attention, and will get it, one way or another. 5. Kleptomaniac,
kleptoschmeniak. I love shiny things, that’s all. 6. There is something
about fire, I can’t explain it, it just speaks to me.</p>
