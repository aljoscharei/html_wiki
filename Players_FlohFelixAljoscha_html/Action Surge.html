<h1 >Action Surge</h1>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal
limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a rest of any length before
you can use it again. Starting at 15th level, you can use it twice
before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>
