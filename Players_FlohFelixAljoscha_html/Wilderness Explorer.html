<h1 >Wilderness Explorer</h1>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you are adept at preparing and securing
campsites in the wilderness so that some of your party can gain
additional benefits during a long rest. Choose a number of creatures up
to your proficiency bonus to each regain an additional Hit Die. You can
include yourself as one of the creatures. If you spend an hour in the
wild and succeed at a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, you can supply
enough food and drink for your party for one day. You must take a long
rest before using this feature again.</p>
