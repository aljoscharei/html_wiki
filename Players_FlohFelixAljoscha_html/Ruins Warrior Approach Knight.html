<h1 >Ruins Warrior Approach
Knight</h1>
<p>You are a noble Knight who fights to break the enemy’s lines or to
hold your own. Heavily armored on the outside and with a deep sense of
duty on the inside, you fight for the favor of your lord, the lives of
your allies or your own family’s glory. Maybe you dream of one day
becoming a member of the Queen’s royal guard, the Pansars, or a Templar
fighting in the name of Prios.</p>
