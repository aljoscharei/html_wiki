<h1 >Ruins class Feats Inquisitor</h1>
<p>• Prerequisite: You have taken the Theurg approach and attained at
least 11th level in the mystic class. You cannot take both the Confessor
and Inquisitor feats.<br />
For some theurgs, whether among priests or Black Cloaks, the hatred of
the dark is so strong that they choose the in- quisitor’s road: to seek
out and destroy the enemies of Prios. Inquisitors are happy to cooperate
with Templars and other members of the Church; they are not interested
in understanding the darkness and tend to rely on cunning, ambushes and
assassination to reach their goals, never brute force like the Templars.
To most inquisitors, sorcerers and their followers have no right to
exist, and for that reason no moral consideration is necessary when they
are fighting the dark.</p>
