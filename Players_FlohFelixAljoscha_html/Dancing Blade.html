<h1 >Dancing Blade</h1>
<p>At 17th level, you can combine your skill with words and weapons to
inspire fear in your enemies. On your first turn of a combat, choose a
creature. If you succeed at a Charisma (Intimidation) check they become
frightened of you until the combat ends. The DC is 10 or their challenge
rating, whichever is higher.</p>
