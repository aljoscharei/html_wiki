Rustic Hospitality</h4>
<p>Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among
them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among
other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them.
They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you,
though they will not risk their lives for you.</p>

them.</p>
