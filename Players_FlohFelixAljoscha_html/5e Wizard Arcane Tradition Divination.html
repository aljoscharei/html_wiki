Divination</p>
<p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike,
for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future.
As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and
consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</p>
<h1 >Divination Savant</h1>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h1 >Portent</h1>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the
future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest,
roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack
roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you
can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so
before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per
turn.</p>
<p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long
rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h1 >Expert Divination</h1>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to
you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When
you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot,
you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a
level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th
level.</p>
<h1 >The Third Eye</h1>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your
powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following
benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or
long rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.</p>
<p>Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as
described in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”</p>
<p>Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of
you.</p>
<p>Greater Comprehension. You can read any language.</p>
<p>See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and objects within
10 feet of you that are within line of sight.</p>
<h1 >Greater Portent</h1>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and
paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll
three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p>
