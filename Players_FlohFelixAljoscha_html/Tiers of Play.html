<h3 >Tiers of Play</h3>
<p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers
of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a
general description of how the play experience changes as characters
gain levels.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first tier</strong> (levels 1–4), characters are
effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that
define them as members of particular classes, including the major
choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a
wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats
they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local
farmsteads or villages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second tier</strong> (levels 5–10), characters come
into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the
start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with
spells such as <a
href="5e%20spells%20lvl%203%20evocation%20fireball%2020%20ft%208d6%20Ruins%20not%20favoured%20w.html">5e
spells lvl 3 evocation fireball 20 ft 8d6 Ruins not favoured w</a> and
<a
href="lightning%20bolt%201%20creat%208d6%20not%20favoured%20w.html">lightning
bolt 1 creat 8d6 not favoured w</a> . At this tier, many weapon-using
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These
characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities
and kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the <strong>third tier</strong> (levels 11–16), characters have
reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace
and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many
spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create
effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other
characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more
impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often
confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p>
<p>At the <strong>fourth tier</strong> (levels 17–20), characters
achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even
the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during
their adventures.</p>
