<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens Ward</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +2 to Intelligence or Charisma<br />
You are responsible for another person, your ward. The ward can be a
beloved child, an elderly but respected mentor, a soulmate or just an
annoying relative whose welfare is con- nected to a future inheritance
for the character. You pay your ward’s lifestyle expenses, which include
basic care- giving, but also must sometimes attend to them directly, for
example the ward might get into trouble and need your aid. The
Gamemaster plays the ward, who has no stats and gains no experience
points for adventuring. If the ward dies or goes missing, you are
afflicted by other problems; sorrow and remorse, mirrored by changing
this burden into a suitable burden (the bonus from this burden fades and
the bonus from the new burden is added). If you protected the person
from love, burdens like Addiction or Nightmares can be appropriate. And
if the protection was related to personal gains, maybe Wanted or Arch
Enemy is better – the relatives of the ward do not easily forget the
character’s betrayal.</p>
