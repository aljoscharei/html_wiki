<h1 >Power Word Kill</h1>
<p><em>9th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see
within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit
points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.</p>

This spell kills some or all of the creatures in one unit within 12
hexes of the caster. Roll 4d8 for the number of Hit Dice affected by the
spell. Divide this total by the Unit HD of the targeted unit to
determine the number of creatures killed. Calculate the ratio of the
number of creatures killed to the original number of creatures in the
unit, and apply an equivalent percentage of damage to the unit’s uhp
(based on its starting uhp). If the unit makes a successful a saving
throw versus Death, it avoids the effect.</p>
<p><a href="ACKS%20Chapter%2005%20Spells#Death%20Spell"></a> | Range: |
240’ | :——– | :———— | Arcane | 6 | Duration: | instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell will kill a total of 4d8 Hit Dice of creatures in a 30’
radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range
limit). If there are more Hit Dice of creatures present than the spell
can kill, the death spell will slay the weakest creatures first. Hit
dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Each
creature affected is allowed a saving throw versus Death; those that
fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more Hit Dice or levels
are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other
creature that is not truly alive.</p>
<h2 >Does it
instantly kill PCs without death saves? YES</h2>
<p>They would instantly die, with no saving throws. However, at this
level, players are assumed to have access to means of resurrection, so
this isn’t as devastating as it would be at earlier levels.</p>
