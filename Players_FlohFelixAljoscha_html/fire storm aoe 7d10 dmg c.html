<h1 >Fire Storm</h1>
<p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you
choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot
cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least
one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br />
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is
unaffected by this spell.</p>

<p>Fire Storm is like the weird love child of <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/fireball">Fireball</a>
and <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/wall-of-fire">Wall
of Fire</a>, and I’m not sold if it’s worth taking over either of the
other two. For something called Fire Storm it just doesn’t FEEL like a
massive Fire Storm, you know?</p>
<p>You always have to default compare a spell to Fireball if we’re
talking about area of effect damage, and while 7d10 is a decent amount
of damage, 12d6 damage is more on average from an up-cast Fireball. Wall
of Fire upcast to 7th level is dealing 8d8 damage, which is barely under
7d10, plus it lasts awhile and has some cool applications with forcing
movements. You’re left with Fire Storm’s two main upsides being the
flexibility of area and the ability to not affect plants.</p>
<p>The common patterns for Fire Storm will be 3x3 grids with an extra
tacked on or weird snaking areas to hit specifically one or two
creatures alongside a group. This ends up being crazy close to
Fireball’s 20 ft. radius sphere already. Is being able to occasionally
hit one or two extra creatures worth your 7th level slot AND having the
spell take up room in your prepared or known spells, even with the
damage drop?</p>
<p>And then there is the plant clause, which I just have to say, what?
What is this text? Why is it here? Do any other fire spells have this
text? What is the point, outside of I guess allowing it on the Druid
spell list? Which, even then, wildfires and controlled burns
historically have had positive environmental effects to my limited
understanding, so that doesn’t seem like a particularly compelling
reason.</p>
<p>Normally I’m all for extra weird goodies that let higher level spells
have niche world building applications, but I can’t fathom a reason why
this text is attached to this spell and this spell alone. It isn’t worth
the space it takes on the page. Let’s say you decide not to ignite the
plants in an area; you’re still igniting all of the objects plant
adjacent. It’s not like there isn’t going to still be a massive area of
fire directly on top of the plants.</p>
<p>Rant aside, Fire Storm is kind of just a nothing spell. It’s another
fire spell in a game bursting with fire spells, and this one is
comparatively pretty underwhelming. Sure, you might find a time or two
to bust it out and get the exact tetris shape you need, but most of the
time a good old fashioned Fireball will do the trick</p>
