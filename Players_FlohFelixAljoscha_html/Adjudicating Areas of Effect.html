<h1 >Adjudicating Areas of Effect</h1>
<p>Many spells and other game features create areas of effect, such as
the cone and the sphere. If you’re not using miniatures or another
visual aid, it can sometimes be difficult to determine who’s in an area
of effect and who isn’t. The easiest way to address such uncertainty is
to go with your gut and make a call.</p>
<p>If you would like more guidance, consider using the Targets in Areas
of Effect table. To use the table, imagine which combatants are near one
another, and let the table guide you in determining the number of those
combatants that are caught in an area of effect. Add or subtract targets
based on how bunched up the potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3
to determine the amount to add or subtract.</p>

<p>For example, if a wizard directs <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands">burning
hands</a> (a 15-foot cone) at a nearby group of <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16972-orc">orcs</a>, you could
use the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 ÷ 10 = 1.5, rounded
up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could launch a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt">lightning
bolt</a> (100-foot line) at some <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre">ogres</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16925-hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a>,
and you could use the table to say four of the monsters are targeted
(100 ÷ 30 = 3.33, rounded up to 4).</p>
<p>This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial precision. If you
prefer more tactical nuance, consider using miniatures.</p>
