<h1 >Rope Trick</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a
twisted loop of parchment)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the
rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to
the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to
an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.<br />
The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the
rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures.
The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from
view outside the space.<br />
Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the
extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through
a 3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.<br />
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell
ends.</p>

<li>
In a situation where your party can’t be seen? Use rope trick and hide
from sight and still be able to see and listen into what is going on in
a room.
</li>
<li>
Your party needs to get to a spot 60 or less feet up in the air? Use
rope trick and have a rope that can climb to any spot in an elevated
position
</li>
<li>
Need a safe place for your party to heal in combat? You guessed it, rope
trick allows pesky dragon breaths and fireballs to not be able to hit
the party or NPCs who are in need of healing or protection.
</li>
<li>
Falling to your doom (like 500+ feet free falling)? Rope trick to stop
your descent and give you an hour to fix the situation.
</li>
<li>
Room filling up with poison or water and you need more time? What do you
know! Rope trick for the win by going into an extradimensional space
that is filled with clean fresh air.
</li>
<li>
Want tactical cover in an empty room? Create a space for you to hide in
with rope trick.
</li>
<li>
Trying to hide questionably gotten goods? Then a small rope trick can be
a perfect way to hide the items off your person if being inspected.
</li>
<li>
Need to securely hold someone or something in place? Tie it up with rope
and let the rope trick hold them there. (Great for interrogations over
cliffs)
</li>
<li>
Looking for a way to hide from those with detect magic, locate objects,
or any other divination spells? Hop into your rope trick, pull the rope
up and be immune to divination effects that require you on the same
plane of existence.
</li>
<li>
Need a safe place to do a short rest? Use the spell as intended and have
a safe place to rest!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Teleportation spells are great emergency spells as they often remove an
item or person from a situation too dangerous for it. 
</p>
<p>
The big downside to these spells is most are too high in their spell
level or take too long to cast to use reliably. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, having a second level spell that will remove you from an area
in a non permanent way is a perfect way to give your character enough
time to build a permanent escape route, or remove themselves from an
imminent threat. 
</p>
<p>
In this way, rope trick is a great emergency spell to giving a character
more time to remove themselves from a threat.
</p>
<p>
A few common examples of threats rope trick circumvents is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Divination spells as they target creatures on the same plane.
</li>
<li>
Dragon breaths and other AOE attacks.
</li>
<li>
About to be discovered by something that would kill you or severely harm
you.
</li>
<li>
Unknown Traps where something bad is about to happen.
</li>
<li>
Surprise situations where the floor is lava or gone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, while not all applications of avoiding a threat. This should get
your brain thinking of what your caster can do when they can at will
remove themselves from the material plane, or remove themselves from
situations that can cause damage. For that reason, Rope Trick, has
become a staple in my caster classes as a great way to give my party
time to adapt and adjust to dangerous encounters.
