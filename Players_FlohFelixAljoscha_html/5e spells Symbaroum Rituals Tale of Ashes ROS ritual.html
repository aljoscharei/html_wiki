<p>2nd-level divination (ritual)</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Components: V, S, M (the ashes of the object) Duration:
Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell allows a mystic to read the ashes of a burnt object and
thereby discern what the object once was and what happened when it
burned â€“ the mystic experiences all impressions from the fire, sees who
was there and hears what was being said. A campfire can have much to
tell about what happened around it.</p>
