<h1 >Spell Mastery</h1>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells
that you can cast them at will and gain no Corruption. Choose two 1st or
2nd level spells that you know. You can cast them at their base level
without gaining any Corruption. If you cast them as a higher level, you
gain Corruption as normal.</p>
