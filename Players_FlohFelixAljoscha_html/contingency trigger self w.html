<h1 >Contingency</h1>
<p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved
from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a
casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that
spell–called the contingent spell–as part of casting
<strong><em>contingency</em></strong>, expending spell slots for both,
but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes
effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that
circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a
<strong><em>contingency</em></strong> cast with <strong><em>water
breathing</em></strong> might stipulate that <strong><em>water
breathing</em></strong> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water
or a similar liquid.<br />
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is
met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then
<strong><em>contingency</em></strong> ends. The contingent spell takes
effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use
only one <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> spell at a time.<br />
If you cast this spell again, the effect of another
<strong><em>contingency</em></strong> spell on you ends. Also,
<strong><em>contingency</em></strong> ends on you if its material
component is ever not on your person.</p>
