<h1 >Guards and Wards</h1>
<p><em>6th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure
of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of monster blood,
and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor
space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or
twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall,
and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold
by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each
contiguous area while you are casting the spell.<br />
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are
unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also
specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.<br />
Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded
area.<br />
- <strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making
them <a href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e heavily obscured</a>. In
addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of
direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you
will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it
chooses.<br />
- <strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by an <strong><em><a
href="arcane_lock%20w.html">arcane_lock w</a></em></strong> spell. In
addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to
the illusory object function of the <strong><em><a
href="5e%20spells%20minor%20illusion%20sight%20or%20sound%20w.html">5e
spells minor illusion sight or sound w</a></em></strong> spell) to make
them appear as plain sections of wall.<br />
- <strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from
top to bottom, as the <a href="5e%20spells%20web%20w.html">5e spells web
w</a> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or
torn away while <strong><em>guards and wards</em></strong> lasts.<br />
- <strong>Other Spell Effect.</strong> You can place your choice of one
of the following magical effects within the warded area of the
stronghold. - Place <a href="5e%20spells%20dancing%20lights%20w.html">5e
spells dancing lights w</a> in four corridors. You can designate a
simple program that the lights repeat as long as <strong><em>guards and
wards</em></strong> lasts. - Place <a
href="magic%20mouth%20w%20ros%20ritual.html">magic mouth w ros ritual</a>
in two locations. - Place <a
href="stinking%20cloud%20Terrain%20control%20w.html">stinking cloud
Terrain control w</a> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places
you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while
guards and wards lasts. - Place a constant <a
href="gust%20of%20wind%20push%20away%20w.html">gust of wind push away
w</a> in one corridor or room - Place a <a
href="suggestion%20mind%20control%20w%20not%20favoured.html">suggestion
mind control w not favoured</a> in one location. You select an area of
up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the
area receives the suggestion mentally. The whole warded area radiates
magic. A <a
href="5e%20spells%20dispel%20magic%20wc%20not%20favoured.html">5e spells
dispel magic wc not favoured</a> cast on a specific effect, if
successful, removes only that effect.<br />
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting
this spell there every day for one year.</p>

Review by Samuel West, Twitter: <span

<p>There comes a time in every adventurer’s life where they decide to
settle down, start a family with the dozen or so NPCs their party has
adopted, and begin a quiet life. This humble origin, paired with Guards
and Wards, are how most of the dungeons of old seemingly sprang into
existence.</p>
<p>Guards and Wards turns your base (or somebody else’s) into a dungeon.
The honest use is setting up your own castle, farmstead, or giant
turtle-back mobile fortress into a gauntlet for protection. At most,
this’ll help in a handful of encounters, and just be something neat to
take to flavorfully develop a home base.</p>
<p>Where the spell gets interesting is when you’re left alone for ten
minutes in somebody else’s fortress! Start with <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/greater-invisibility">Greater
Invisibility</a> on yourself, get your ranger to hit you with a <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/pass-without-trace">Pass
without Trace</a>, then proceed to walk the mundane halls of a corrupt
prince’s estate and make their life a living hell! They now notice there
are entire doors and rooms missing, are constantly getting lost in the
fog that permeates the space. Phallic dancing lights taunting them
wherever they go, and they can hear a Magic Mouth endlessly tormenting
them with insults and slander from somewhere in the floors. It sure
would be rough if their bedchamber was a windtunnel, wouldn’t it? It’d
be a crying shame if the entire kitchen staff was perpetually subject to
Suggestion, suggesting they throw all the food they make at their
lord!</p>
<p>DMing with Guards and Wards is DMing on easy mode. If you’re planning
on running a well defended dungeon of a high level caster and need some
traps, look no further than the organic ones found in the Player’s
Handbook. The fog, Arcane Lock, Stinking Cloud, and Web effects all lend
themselves to a variety of interesting encounters. You really don’t need
a whole lot else to make some fun nights of dungeon crawling and monster
slaying than a Monster Manual, Guards and Wards, and a map.</p>
<p>There are few spells in D&amp;D that are at their best as silly
pranks; Guards and Wards is my personal favorite of the bunch. The
honest way to cast it can be great a handful of times, as it does an
admirable job at protecting a space. It can aid the transition from
player to DM, and offers a fundamental toolkit for new DMs looking to
fill a dungeon with traps and magic. All in all, Guards and Wards is an
excellent spell; now go transform the local baron’s estate into a
personalized nightmare for him.</p>
