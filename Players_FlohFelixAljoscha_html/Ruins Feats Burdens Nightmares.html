Nightmares</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +2 to Constitution<br />
You are haunted by nightmares each and every night, possi- bly because
of something you have experienced, or for more abstruse reasons, such as
an ominous omen or the conse- quence of a family curse. Each night, you
must pass a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of
exhaustion.</p>
