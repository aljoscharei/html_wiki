passive checks from the 5th Edition (5e) System Reference Document
(SRD)</p>
<h1 >Ability Checks</h1>
<p>If the Player Character attempts something where the outcome is
uncertain, there are two ways of resolution: - The players knows
something about the situation and comes up with a plan. If the plan is
plausible, there might be not need to roll the dice at all as the
outcome is as good as certain. - The situation is difficult to
understand or the player cannot come up with a plausible plan, but the
PC might be successfull: Roll an <a href="ability%20check.html">ability
check</a>, where <a
href="Die%20Rolls%20represent%20Environmental%20Variation">Die Rolls
represent Environmental Variation</a>. Or the player can come up with a
plausible plan which just might fail. For example: The player does not
know anything about orientation but the players plays a Ranger who would
be able to find his way.</p>
<p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and
training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an
ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than
an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine the results.</p>
<p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is
relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented
by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The
Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>
<h4 >Typical Difficulty Classes</h4>

</table>
<p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
ability check is a success–the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
determined by the GM.</p>
<p>unlike rolling a 1 or 20 in combat <a

not have a special meaning in <a href="ability%20check.html">ability

<h2 >Contests</h2>
<p>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed
to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same
thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic
ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one
of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal–for
example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is
holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a
special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>
<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to
their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but
instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their
two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the
contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or
prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>
<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it
was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by
default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the
floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying
to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie
means that the door remains shut.</p>
<h2 >Skills</h2>
<p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills
that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a
specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in
a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting
skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a
monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)</p>
<p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to
pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each
of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,
Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>
<p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following
list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s
description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to
use a skill associated with an ability.</p>
<h3 >Strength</h3>
<ul>
<li>Athletics</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Dexterity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acrobatics</li>
<li>Sleight of Hand</li>
<li>Stealth</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arcana</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Investigation</li>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Religion</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Wisdom</h3>
<ul>
<li>Animal Handling</li>
<li>Insight</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Survival</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Charisma</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deception</li>
<li>Intimidation</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Persuasion</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific
skill–for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a
player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to
a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can
add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal
ability check.</p>
<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff,
the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is
proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to
the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she
just makes a Strength check.</p>
<h3 >Variant: Skills with
Different Abilities</h3>
<p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind
of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies
to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might
reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM
might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill,
or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different
check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the
mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have
the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you
to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution
(Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your
proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally
do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-­‐‑orc
barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM
might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation
is normally associated with Charisma.</p>
<h2 >Passive Checks</h2>
<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t
involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for
a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over
again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether
the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as
noticing a hidden monster.</p>
<p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage,
subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a
<strong>score</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
score of 14.</p>
<p>The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive
checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>
<h2 >Working Together</h2>
<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
character who’s leading the effort–or the one with the highest ability
modifier–can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help
provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help
action.</p>
<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she
could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires
proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that
proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a
character can help only when two or more individuals working together
would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle,
are no easier with help.</p>
<h3 >Group Checks</h3>
<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a
group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
aren’t.</p>
<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the
ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group
succeeds.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don’t come up very often,
and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a
group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM
might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters
can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the
environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful
characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise,
the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>
