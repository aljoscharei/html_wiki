<h1 >Urchin</h1>
<p>You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one
to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for
yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out
for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness
without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You’ve
survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed,
or some combination of each.</p>
<p>You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly
but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What
allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on
a better life?</p>

City Secrets</h4>
<p>You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages
through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in
combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two
locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally
allow.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for
ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with
whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a
better life — and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who
treated them badly.</p>
