<p>description: Rules for managing movement and position in combat from
the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).</p>
<h1 >Movement and Position</h1>
<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often
using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use
as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following
the rules here.</p>
<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These
different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can
constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the
distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.</p>
<h2 >Breaking Up Your Move</h2>
<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed
before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30
feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
<h3 >Moving between Attacks</h3>
<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you
can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks.
For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack
feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an
attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
<h3 >Using Different Speeds</h3>
<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a
flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during
your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already
moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can
move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the
current move.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60
because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then
walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more</p>

<h2 >Being Prone</h2>
<p>^e6771a</p>
<p><a href="Prone.html">Prone</a> Combatants often find themselves lying
on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they
throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition
described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your
speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of
movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30
feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up
if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1
extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3
feet of movement.</p>

<h2 >Creature Size</h2>
<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size
Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size
controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>

<h3 >Space</h3>
<p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls
in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical
Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a
space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway,
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
<p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures
that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
combatants, <strong>eight</strong> creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius
around another one.</p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can
surround a creature. If <strong>four</strong> Large creatures crowd
around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In
contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan
one. see <a href="5e%20Gridded%20Combat.html">5e Gridded Combat</a></p>
