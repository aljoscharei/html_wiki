<p><em>5th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of
creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose
a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma
saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.<br />
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor,
weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter
or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a
target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic
arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to
you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to
dismiss it sooner.<br />
<strong>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
inspection</strong>. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to
a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who
touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and
hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of
someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was
seemingly still in midair.<br />
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it
succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.</p>
