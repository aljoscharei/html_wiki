<h1 >Expenses</h1>
<p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for
lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness,
adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world,
people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and
clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more
than others.</p>

<p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food
items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your
total lifestyle expenses.</p>

<p>Food Cultures</p>
<p>The food cultures of the clans and the Ambrians are varied, but

etc.) while the barbarian dishes are more rustic, such as stews and
barbecues.</p>

<h2 >Services</h2>
<p><a href="5e%20Hireling.html">5e Hireling</a> Adventurers can pay
nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety
of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while
others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with
specialized adventuring skills.</p>
<p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services
table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people
who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to
perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to
construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the
secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a
special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for
an upcoming in front of the duke.</p>
<p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary
soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are
hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a
high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she
might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a
castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live
within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p>

<p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that
involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary,
artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert
hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial
work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers,
porters, maids, and similar workers.</p>

<h2 >Spellcasting Services</h2>
<p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of
ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast
a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no
established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the
desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the
more it costs.</p>
<p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level,
such as <strong><em>cure wounds</em></strong> or
<strong><em>identify</em></strong>, is easy enough in a city or town,
and might cost <strong>10 to 50 gold pieces</strong> (plus the cost of
any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to
cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city,
perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the
spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment–the kind of
service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare
item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness
to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>
