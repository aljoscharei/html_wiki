Researcher</h4>
<p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not
know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain
it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium,
university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might
rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost
inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the
deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a
whole campaign.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their
characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly
pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly — sometimes in its own right,
sometimes as a means toward other ideals.</p>
