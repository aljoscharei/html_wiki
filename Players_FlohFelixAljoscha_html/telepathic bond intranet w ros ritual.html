<h1 >Telepathic Bond</h1>
<p><em>5th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two
different kinds of creatures)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of
your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the
others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less
aren’t affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, the targets can
communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a
common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though
it can’t extend to other planes of existence.</p>
