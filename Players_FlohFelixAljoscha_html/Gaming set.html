<h1 >Gaming set</h1>
<p><strong>Gaming Set.</strong> This item encompasses a wide range of
game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as
Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but
other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming
set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to
play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate
proficiency. | Item | Cost | Weight | | ————————– | —- | —— | | <a
