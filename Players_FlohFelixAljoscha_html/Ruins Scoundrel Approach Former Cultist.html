<h1 >Ruins Scoundrel
Approach Former Cultist</h1>
<p>Many sorcerers foster cults around themselves and their beliefs,
promising drug-induced insights and black sal- vation to those willing
to follow the mystic into the dark. Not many defect from such cults and
those who do and survive more than a few days are fewer still, hunted as
they are by both the cult they left behind and by witch hunters and
Black Cloaks. The situation is not made any easier by the defector’s own
burdens – memories of ser- vices rendered to please their master and
explicitly cruel actions performed in the name of the cult weigh most
Former Cultists down and haunt their nightmares long after leaving the
master.</p>
<p>You might have been a deeply convinced fanatic, or someone for whom
the membership was more of a practical choice motivated by ambition or
greed. However, if one is to believe the interrogation protocols of the
Black Cloaks, desperation is the most common characteristic among
cultists – the injustices of life combined with a charismatic leader who
promises redemption and strength can be an attractive combination. But
no matter your background, the choices of the cultist were never
innocent; your hands are forever colored by blood.</p>
