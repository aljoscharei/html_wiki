<p><em>3rd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fleece)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a
spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems
completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate
to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause
damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature,
or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s
stench).<br />
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action
to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image
changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a
creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds
at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for
example.<br />
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
creature.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled,
without requiring your concentration.</p>
