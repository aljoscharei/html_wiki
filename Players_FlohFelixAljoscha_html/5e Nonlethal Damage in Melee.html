<h1 >5e Nonlethal Damage in Melee</h1>
<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use
an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar
forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed
strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You
are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Stan Shinn: NONLETHAL DAMAGE: PC declares theyâ€™re dealing nonlethal
damage. Deal damage as normal, if reduce target to 0 HP or fewer, target
simply has 0 HP and falls unconscious.</p>
