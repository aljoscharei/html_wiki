<h1 >Acrobatic Fighter</h1>
<p>By 3rd level, if you are not already proficient with Acrobatics you
become proficient with that skill. When a weapon attack targets you, you
can use your reaction to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with the
attack roll result as the DC. If you succeed, you take no damage from
the attack.</p>
