<h1 >5e MM Introduction</h1>
<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p>This bestiary is for storytellers and world-builders. If you have
ever thought about running a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for your
friends, either a single night’s adventure or a long-running campaign,
this tome contains page after page of inspiration. It’s your one-stop
shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.</p>
<p>Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of D&amp;D have origins
rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures
are D&amp;D originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from
all previous editions of the game. Herein you’ll discover classic
critters such as the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholder</a>
and the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17130-displacer-beast">displacer
beast</a> next to more recent creations such as the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16824-chuul">chuul</a> and the
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17095-twig-blight">twig
blight</a>. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the
ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the past, we’ve endeavored to
reflect the multifaceted nature of the game, warts and all. D&amp;D
monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill
us but also make us smile.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced Dungeon Master (DM), a few of the monster
write-ups might surprise you, for we’ve gone into the <em>Monster
Manuals</em> of yore and discovered some long-lost factoids. We’ve also
added a few new twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what
you will. Nothing we say here is intended to curtail your creativity. If
the minotaurs in your world are shipbuilders and pirates, who are we to
argue with you? It’s your world, after all.</p>
<h2 >How to Use These Rules</h2>
<p>The best thing about being a DM is that you get to invent your own
fantasy world and bring it to life, and nothing brings a D&amp;D world
to life more than the creatures that inhabit it. You might read a
monster’s entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around
it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the
right monsters to populate it. That’s where the <em>Monster Manual</em>
comes in handy.</p>
<p>The <em>Monster Manual</em> is one of three books that form the
foundation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, the other two being the
<a href="5e%20players%20handbook.html">5e players handbook</a> and the <a
href="5e%20Dungeon%20Masters%20Guide">5e Dungeon Masters Guide</a>. The
<em>Monster Manual</em>, like the Dungeon Master’s Guide, is a book for
DMs. Use it to populate your D&amp;D adventures with pesky goblins,
stinky troglodytes, savage orcs, mighty dragons, and a veritable horde
of creepy crawlies.</p>
<p>Guidelines for creating encounters with monsters can be found in the
Dungeon Master’s Guide <a
href="5e%20DMG%20Ch3%20Creating%20Adventures%20Creating%20Encounters">5e
DMG Ch3 Creating Adventures Creating Encounters</a>. That book also
contains wandering monster tables and other goodies to help you use the
monsters in this book in interesting ways, as well as advice for
modifying monsters and creating your own.</p>
<p>If you’ve never run a D&amp;D adventure before, we recommend that you
pick up the Dungeons &amp; Dragons <em>Starter Set</em>, which
demonstrates how to take a bunch of monsters and build an exciting
adventure around them.</p>
<h2 >What Is a Monster?</h2>
<p>A monster is defined as any creature that can be interacted with and
potentially fought and killed. Even something as harmless as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16866-frog">frog</a> or as
benevolent as a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17042-unicorn">unicorn</a> is a
monster by this definition. The term also applies to humans, elves,
dwarves, and other folk who might be friends or rivals to the player
characters. Most of the monsters that haunt the D&amp;D world, however,
are threats that are meant to be stopped: rampaging demons, conniving
devils, soul-sucking undead, summoned elementals — the list goes on.</p>
<p>This book contains ready-to-play, easy-to-run monsters of all levels,
and for nearly every climate and terrain imaginable. Whether your
adventure takes place in a swamp, a dungeon, or the outer planes of
existence, there are creatures in this book to populate that
environment.</p>
<h3 >[Where Do Monsters Dwell?</h3>
<p>If you are new to the D&amp;D game, you might not be familiar with
the weird and wondrous places where monsters can be found and
fought.</p>
<h4 >Dungeons</h4>
<p>When most people think of a dungeon, images of dark cells with iron
bars and shackles spring to mind. In the D&amp;D game, the word
“dungeon” takes on a broader meaning to include any enclosed,
monster-infested location. Most dungeons are sprawling underground
complexes. Here are a few other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ruined wizard’s tower atop a lonely hill riddled with
goblin-infested tunnels</li>
<li>A pharaoh’s pyramid filled with haunted crypts and secret treasure
vaults</li>
<li>A lost city in the jungle, overgrown with vines and overrun with
demons and demon-worshiping cultists</li>
<li>The icy tomb of a frost giant king</li>
<li>A filthy, labyrinthine sewer system controlled by a gang of
wererats</li>
</ul>
<h4 >The Underdark</h4>
<p>There is no greater dungeon than the Underdark, the underworld
beneath the surface world. It is a vast subterranean realm where
monsters accustomed to darkness dwell. It is a place filled with
lightless caverns connected by tunnels that wind ever downward. One
could spend a lifetime (however brief!) exploring the Underdark and find
such places as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mind flayer prison or asylum, filled with mindless thralls and
tormented captives</li>
<li>A lost dwarven necropolis containing row after row of dusty tombs
waiting to be plundered</li>
<li>A fortified outpost bristling with armaments, guarding the way to a
magnificent drow city</li>
<li>A subterranean rift filled with giant fungi and ruled by a
megalomaniacal beholder or fomorian king</li>
<li>A chain of rocky islands on a vast, sunless sea that’s home to
aboleths and kuo-toa</li>
</ul>
<h4 >The Wilderness</h4>
<p>Not all monsters lurk underground. Many of them inhabit deserts,
mountains, swamps, canyons, forests, and other natural settings. The
wilderness can be just as dangerous as any dungeon, particularly when
there’s nowhere to hide! Some wilderness locations are just as memorable
as any dungeon:</p>
<ul>
<li>A roc’s nest made of shattered ship hulls, built atop a lonely
mountain or rocky hill</li>
<li>A vast arctic tundra that serves as a hunting ground for berserkers
and yeti</li>
<li>A primeval forest protected by treants or corrupted by
demon-worshiping gnolls</li>
<li>A fog-shrouded swamp haunted by lizardfolk that worship a vile black
dragon</li>
<li>A jungle island inhabited by dinosaurs and human tribal
warriors</li>
</ul>
<h4 >Towns and Cities</h4>
<p>Some of the best adventures unfold in the cradles of civilization.
Urban settings afford adventurers the chance to rub shoulders with the
rich and powerful, butt heads with the dregs of society, and peel back
the veneer of civility to see the monstrous evil lurking beneath. Within
a medieval town or city are places as deadly as any dungeon:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clock tower that serves as a base for a guild of kenku rogues and
assassins</li>
<li>A thieves’ guild hidden in an orphanage run by a rakshasa disguised
as the headmaster</li>
<li>A wizard’s academy rife with corruption and practitioners of the
necromantic arts</li>
<li>A noble’s manor where rich, devil-worshiping cultists gather to
perform sacrifices</li>
<li>A temple, vault, or museum watched day and night by animated
constructs</li>
</ul>
<h4 >Underwater</h4>
<p>Not all adventures take place on land. This book casts light on
several creatures that haunt the oceans of the world, from the devilish
sahuagin to the peaceful aquatic elves who loathe them. Within this
aquatic domain are many surprising adventure locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A graveyard of sunken ships haunted by sharks, aquatic ghouls, and
angry ghosts</li>
<li>A storm giant’s coral castle, beautiful yet foreboding</li>
<li>A lost city on the sea floor, encased in a magic bubble of air and
ruled by a medusa queen</li>
<li>A kraken’s cave or bronze dragon’s cavernous lair, filled with
ancient treasures</li>
<li>A sunken temple of Sekolah, evil god of the sahuagin</li>
</ul>
<h4 >The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>The Abyss. The Nine Hells. The City of Brass. Such faraway places
beckon high-level adventurers to their doorsteps, defying the brave and
the foolhardy to overthrow their evil masters and unlock their hidden
mysteries. Many powerful, weird creatures live on other planes of
existence, from orderly modrons to murderous demons. When it comes to
interesting adventure locations, not even the sky is the limit when you
pass beyond the boundaries of the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pit fiend’s stronghold on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine
Hells</li>
<li>A haunted castle in the Shadowfell that serves as a shadow dragon’s
lair</li>
<li>An elf queen’s tomb in the Feywild</li>
<li>A djinni’s palace on the Elemental Plane of Air, filled with
marvelous stolen treasures</li>
<li>A lich’s secret demiplane, where the undead archmage hides its
phylactery and spellbook</li>
</ul>

Master’s Guide</a> for more information on the <a

<h3 >[What Monsters to Use?</h3>
<p>Many monsters inhabit dungeons, while others live in deserts,
forests, labyrinths, and other environments. Regardless of which
environment a monster traditionally calls home, you can place it
anywhere you want. After all, “fish out of water” stories are memorable,
and sometimes it’s fun to surprise players with <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16912-grick">gricks</a> hiding
under the desert sands or a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16849-dryad">dryad</a> living
in a giant mushroom in the Underdark.</p>
<h2 >Statistics</h2>
<p>A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its <strong>stat
block</strong>, provide the essential information that you need to run
the monster.</p>
<h3 >Size</h3>
<p>A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The
Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular
size controls in combat. See the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> for
more information on creature size and space.</p>
<h3 >Type</h3>
<p>A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells,
magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in
special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4578-arrow-of-slaying">arrow
of dragon slaying</a> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also
other creatures of the dragon type, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16845-dragon-turtle">dragon
turtles</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17065-wyvern">wyverns</a>.</p>
<p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of
their own.</p>
<p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them
have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind
rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential
aberrations are <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16762-aboleth">aboleths</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17099-beholder">beholders</a>,
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer">mind
flayers</a>, and slaadi.</p>
<p><strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural
part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most
are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all
varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of
animals.</p>
<p><strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes.
Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or
agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are
good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good
alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16832-couatl">couatls</a>, and
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16977-pegasus">pegasi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed
by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others
are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are
the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of
Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material
of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient
origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic
dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have
innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to
true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical,
such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17065-wyvern">wyverns</a> and
<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16986-pseudodragon">pseudodragons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses
of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called
elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy.
The races of genies, including <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16842-djinni">djinn</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16854-efreeti">efreet</a>, form
the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other
elemental creatures include <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16794-azer">azers</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16934-invisible-stalker">invisible
stalkers</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17208-water-weird">water
weirds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces
of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some
worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of
Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes
of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16849-dryad">dryads</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17192-pixie">pixies</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17005-satyr">satyrs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more
labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests
and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their
bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost
inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16921-hell-hound">hell
hounds</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16990-rakshasa">rakshasas</a>,
and yugoloths.</p>
<p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are
humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16860-ettin">ettins</a>) or
deformities (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17146-fomorian">fomorians</a>).
The six varieties of true giant are <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16923-hill-giant">hill
giants</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17024-stone-giant">stone
giants</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16867-frost-giant">frost
giants</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16862-fire-giant">fire
giants</a>, <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16827-cloud-giant">cloud
giants</a>, and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17026-storm-giant">storm
giants</a>. Besides these, creatures such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre">ogres</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17040-troll">trolls</a> are
giants.</p>
<p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of the D&amp;D world,
both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of
other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical
abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal
form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as
player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as
numerous, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and
bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>
<p>A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races
detailed in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a> — with the exception of drow — are dealt with in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/nonplayer-characters">appendix
B</a>. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use
to make various members of those races.</p>
<p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense —
frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and
almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation
gone awry (such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16975-owlbear">owlbears</a>),
and others are the product of terrible curses (including <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16958-minotaur">minotaurs</a>
and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a
catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.</p>
<p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a
fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and
dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to
get in their way. <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16808-black-pudding">Black
puddings</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16869-gelatinous-cube">gelatinous
cubes</a> are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>
<p><strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not
ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous.
The quintessential plants are the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17011-shambling-mound">shambling
mound</a> and the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17037-treant">treant</a>.
Fungal creatures such as the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17147-gas-spore">gas spore</a>
and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a
horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or
some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17043-vampire">vampires</a> and
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie">zombies</a>,
as well as bodiless spirits, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16871-ghost">ghosts</a> and <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter">specters</a>.</p>
<h4 >Tags</h4>
<p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in
parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type.
The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain
creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the
game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear
that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any
monster that has the demon tag.</p>
<h3 >Alignment</h3>
<p>A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it
behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic
evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack
characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to
negotiate. See the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> for
descriptions of the different alignments.</p>
<p>The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default.
Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the
needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an
evil <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17026-storm-giant">storm
giant</a>, there’s nothing stopping you.</p>
<p>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other
words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment
entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.
For example, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16805-berserker">berserker</a>
can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic
evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>
<p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or
chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but
rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>,
which means they don’t have an alignment.</p>
<h3 >Armor Class</h3>
<p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class
(AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account.
Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural
armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a
shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>
<h3 >Hit Points</h3>
<p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.
For more on hit points, see the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as
an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit
points on average (2 × 4½).</p>
<p>A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points,
as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>
<h4 ><a

Dice by Size</h4>

</table>
<p>A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit
points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of
Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For
example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).</p>
<h3 >Speed</h3>
<p>A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more
information on <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#Speed">speed</a>,
see the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s
speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a
walking speed of 0 feet.</p>
<p>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement
modes.</p>
<h4 >Burrow</h4>
<p>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move
through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid
rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.</p>
<h4 >Climb</h4>
<p>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its
movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend
extra movement to climb.</p>
<h4 >Fly</h4>
<p>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement
to fly. Some monsters have the ability to <strong>hover</strong>, which
makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#FlyingMovement">flying</a>
in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.</p>
<h4 >Swim</h4>
<p>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra
movement to swim.</p>
<h3 >Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding
modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used
in play, see the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3 >Saving Throws</h3>
<p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at
resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t
easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving
throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which
case this section is absent.</p>
<p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s
challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
table).</p>

<h3 >Skills</h3>
<p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one
or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and
stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception">Perception</a>)
and Dexterity (<a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth">Stealth</a>)
checks.</p>
<p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and
its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge
rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).
Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a
larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to
account for its heightened expertise.</p>
<h3 >Vulnerabilities,
Resistances, and Immunities</h3>
<p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain
types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to
damage from non-magical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered
by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some
creatures are immune to certain conditions.</p>
<h3 >Senses</h3>
<p>The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score,
as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are
described below.</p>
<h4 >Blindsight</h4>
<p>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without
relying on sight, within a specific radius.</p>
<p>Creatures without eyes, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16914-grimlock">grimlocks</a>
and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16909-gray-ooze">gray
oozes</a>, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with
echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.</p>
<p>If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this
effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum
range of its perception.</p>
<h4 >Darkvision</h4>
<p>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific
radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live
underground have this special sense.</p>
<h4 >Tremorsense</h4>
<p>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of
vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the
source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or
substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal
creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16787-ankheg">ankhegs</a> and
<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17205-umber-hulk">umber
hulks</a>, have this special sense.</p>
<h4 >Truesight</h4>
<p>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal
and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically
detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and
perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal
Plane within the same range.</p>
<h3 >Languages</h3>
<p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical
order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it,
and this is noted in its entry. A “ — ” indicates that a creature
neither speaks nor understands any language.</p>
<h4 >Telepathy</h4>
<p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate
mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted
creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to
communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at
least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond
to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic
conversation.</p>
<p>A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can
end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as
the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the
telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A
telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation
without using an action, but while the monster is <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>,
it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is
terminated.</p>
<p>A creature within the area of an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field">antimagic
field</a> or in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t
send or receive telepathic messages.</p>
<h3 >Challenge</h3>
<p>A monster’s <strong>challenge rating</strong> tells you how great a
threat the monster is, according to the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#CreatingEncounters">encounter-building
guidelines</a> in <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures">chapter
3</a> of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon
Master’s Guide</a>. Those guidelines specify the numbers of adventurers
of a certain level that should be able to defeat a monster of a
particular challenge rating without suffering any deaths. An
appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should
be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its
level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four
3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3
to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p>
<p>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have
a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0
are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective
attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks
are worth 10 XP each.</p>
<p>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical
20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of
21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.</p>
<h4 >Experience Points</h4>
<p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on
its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the
monster, although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat
posed by the monster in some other manner.</p>
<p>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell
or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s
Guide</a> explains how to <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#BuildingEncountersonaBudget">create
encounters using XP budgets</a>, as well as how to adjust an encounter’s
difficulty.</p>

<h3 >Special Traits</h3>
<p>Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but
before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to
be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.</p>
<h4 >Innate Spellcasting</h4>
<p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate
Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of
1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and
can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its
level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge
rating.</p>
<p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example,
a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17135-drow-mage">drow
mage</a> can innately cast the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/levitate">levitate</a> spell, but
the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell
affects only the drow mage.</p>
<p>A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If
a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is
given for them.</p>
<h4 >Spellcasting</h4>
<p>A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level
and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and
higher (as explained in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>). The
spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the
feature.</p>
<p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular
class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class,
such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle
feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class
when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the
class or access to its spell list.</p>
<p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has
the spell slot to do so. For example, a <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17135-drow-mage">drow mage</a>
with the 3rd-level <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt">lightning
bolt</a> spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its
5th-level spell slots.</p>
<p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared,
replacing any spell on a monster’s spell list with a different spell of
the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might
cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its
challenge rating.</p>
<h4 >Psionics</h4>
<p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the
psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special
trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of
the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically
doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.</p>
<h3 >Actions</h3>
<p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in
the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions
available to all creatures, such as the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash">Dash</a>
or <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide">Hide</a>
action, as described in the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<h4 >Melee and Ranged Attacks</h4>
<p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee
and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where
the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a
claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks,
see the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s
Handbook</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Creature vs. Target.</strong></em> The target of a melee
or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the
difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hit.</strong></em> Any damage dealt or other effects that
occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the
“<em>Hit</em>” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or
rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die
expression are presented.</p>
<p><em><strong>Miss.</strong></em> If an attack has an effect that
occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the
“<em>Miss:</em>” notation.</p>
<h4 >Multiattack</h4>
<p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the
Multiattack ability. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#OpportunityAttacks">opportunity
attack</a>, which must be a single melee attack.</p>
<h4 >Ammunition</h4>
<p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks.
<strong>You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of
ammunition</strong> for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of
ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p>
<h3 >Reactions</h3>
<p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that
information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction,
this section is absent.</p>
<h3 >Limited Usage</h3>
<p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they
can be used.</p>
<p><strong><em>X/Day.</em></strong> The notation “X/Day” means a special
ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a
long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special
ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to
use it again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recharge X–Y.</em></strong> The notation “Recharge X–Y”
means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then
has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of
combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the
roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains
the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the
monster finishes a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can use the special
ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the
use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong></em> This
notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then
must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p>
<h3 >Equipment</h3>
<p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons
used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a
humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>
<p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you
like, using the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment">equipment
chapter</a> of the <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a> for
inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is
recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that
equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster
is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.</p>
<p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its
spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the
spells in its stat block.</p>
<h2 >Legendary Creatures</h2>
<p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t.
Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns, and a
few can exert power over their environment, causing extraordinary
magical effects to occur in their vicinity.</p>
<p>If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as
through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair
actions, or regional effects.</p>
<h3 >Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions —
called legendary actions — outside its turn. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s
turn. A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start
of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>
or otherwise unable to take actions. If <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>,
it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.</p>
<h3 >A Legendary Creature’s Lair</h3>
<p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the
special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or
simply by being present. Not all legendary creatures have lairs. This
section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of
time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.</p>
<h4 >Lair Actions</h4>
<p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness
the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all
initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do
so while <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>
or otherwise unable to take actions. If <a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise">surprised</a>,
it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.</p>
<h4 >Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and
wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional
effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature
dies.</p>
