<p>With this spell the caster can heal those already tainted by
darkness, though at a danger of gaining more Corruption. For each
willing creature within range (including the caster), roll 1d4 plus your
spellcasting modifier. If the result is equal to or lower than their
permanent Corruption then they recover hit points equal to the result.
If it is higher than their permanent Corruption then they gain the
difference in temporary Corruption.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 3rd level or higher, you
add 1 to your result for each level above 2nd.</p>
