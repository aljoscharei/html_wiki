<h1 >Hellish Rebuke</h1>
<p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take in response
to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can
see<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S <strong>Duration:</strong>
Instantaneous</p>
<p>You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is
momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a
Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. <strong>At Higher
Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
1st.</p>
<p>Narratively the creature suffers the same wounds as the caster, but
burning. Maybe its like a glowing coal attacking the target? Or rather a
vengeful spirit.</p>
