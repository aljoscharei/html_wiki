<h2 >Know Your Players</h2>
<p>The success of a D&amp;D game hinges on your ability to entertain the
other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create
characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them,
and help steer the campaign through their characters’ actions, your role
is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the
world you’ve created, and to let their characters do awesome things.</p>
<p>Knowing what your players enjoy most about the D&amp;D game helps you
create and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you
know which of the following activities each player in your group enjoys
the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players’
preferences as much as possible, thus keeping them engaged.</p>
