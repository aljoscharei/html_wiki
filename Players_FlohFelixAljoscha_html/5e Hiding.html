<h1 >5e Hiding</h1>
<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When
you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are
discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the
Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for
signs of your presence.</p>
<p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give
away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or
knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide.
Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay
quiet.</p>
<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around,
so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees
you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to
stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you
to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>
<h2 ><strong>Passive Perception.</strong></h2>
<p>When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they
aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the
DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive
Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom
modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has
advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a
1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15
(a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive
Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>
<h2 ><strong>What Can You See?</strong></h2>
<p>One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden
creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <a

href="5e%20heavily%20obscured.html">5e heavily obscured</a></p>
