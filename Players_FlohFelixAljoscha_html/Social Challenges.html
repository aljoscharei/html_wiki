<h1 >Social Challenges</h1>
<p>Social Challenges are problems and situations where the players will
have to roleplay their way out of trouble; tactics and just rolling dice
is not enough. Sure, a social challenge is often preceded by
problem-solving or even combat, but during the challenge itself the
players, portraying their characters, must convince someone or some
faction to do as the player characters want.</p>
<p>Appropriate Social Challenge</p>
<p>It requires more than just a couple of Charisma (Persuasion) checks
to have an exciting scene of social conflict. It will feel more
rewarding if the players roleplay out the bulk of the scene, using dice
and ability checks only to establish the initial scene and to finalize
the solution once the heroes propose a compromise.</p>
<p>A scene where a powerful person, creature or group must be convinced
makes for an interesting social challenge. Meetings with less important
persons can also be made into social challenges, if the outcome of the
scene (profit from success, cost from failure) is of enough importance
to the player characters.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the social challenge as the last step in an
extended problem: the characters must bribe, con- vince and trick a
number of administrators, advisors and guards in order to get an
audience with one of the Queen’s dukes. This requires a series of
ability checks, just like in an extended problem-solving situation. The
game then turns into a social challenge when the characters finally
stand in front of the duke or duchess.</p>
<p>The GMs Role</p>
<p>In social challenges, the Gamemaster must decide what is at stake for
the target of the player characters: what does the target have to win
from doing as the player characters suggest? What does the target have
to lose? What is the pos- sible cost of deciding to do something else?
For a situation to be a social challenge there has to be a real
possibility for both success and failure on the player characters’ part,
even if the odds may lean one way or the other.</p>
<h1 >The Social Challenge</h1>
<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to have a meaningful meeting, the party’s subject needs to
know who they are and why their opinions, questions or requests should
be honored. For some non-player characters well-acquainted with the
characters this might be automatic, for others this will require a group
check, using the appropriate skills – usually Charisma (Persuasion), but
some characters might use Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception,
Intimidation or Performance) instead. Some groups might propose a single
spokesperson instead, the chart below gives results for a single roll in
parentheses. The Gamemaster sets the DC depending on the subject’s
reaction to the meeting (DC 10 – indifferent, DC 15 – reluctant, DC 20 –
opposed). The following outcomes are possible: - Almost all succeed
(success by 5 or more). The subject is convinced that this meeting is
important. Unless the discussion changes their mind, the group has
advantage on the evaluation roll - More than half succeed (basic
success). The subject is willing to conduct the meeting. The group might
earn advantage or disadvantage during the discussion but currently has
neither. - At least some succeed (basic failure). The subject al- lows
the meeting, but is predisposed against the group. Unless the discussion
changes their mind, the group has disadvantage on the evaluation roll. -
All fail (failure by 5 or more). The subject refuses the meeting. The
group cannot try again until something significant changes.</p>
<h2 >Discussion</h2>
<p>Now the talk turns to specifics – what do the characters want? What
can they offer? The player characters, the subject, and other non-player
characters discuss the issue. The GM keeps a mental tally during the
discussion – if most of the proposals are reasonable and account for the
subject’s opinions, powers, and feelings then the group might earn
<strong>advantage on the evaluation roll</strong>. The reverse is also
true if the characters are arrogant, obstinate or poorly prepared.
Advantage here cancels out disadvantage on the introduction and
disadvantage cancels out advantage as well.</p>
<h2 >Evaluation</h2>
<p>Once the discussion reaches a decision point, one charac- ter in the
group makes another check against the same DC used for the introduction.
This indicates the final result of the meeting: - Success by 5 or more.
The subject agrees completely with the group and does whatever they can
to support them. This may include reaching out to others in posi- tions
of power. - Regular success. The subject is willing to help the group
but has limitations on what they can offer. However, the primary
objective of the characters is met. - Regular failure. The subject is
unwilling or unable to help the group in any significant way. However,
they might offer a minor concession to avoid future awkwardness (for
example perhaps they can’t offer any of their warriors but can provide
enough shillings that the group could hire some mercenaries for a short
time.) - Failure by 5 ormore.The meeting breaks down entirely, perhaps
the character misread the situation or the subject is completely unable
or unwilling to aid the group. Their only hope is to leave quickly and
trust that the subject has a short memory.</p>

<p>Example of Social Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a baron release the player characters from captivity in
exchange for them performing some dirty work for the baron.</li>
<li>Convincing a lindworm with delusions of grandeur that the player
characters are too insignificant to be worth killing, and that it would
be better to let them go so they can spread word of the serpent’s
unparalleled frightfulness.</li>
<li>Persuading a count to hand over the residency of a keep; the count
must choose between making the characters vassals, installing one of
them as baron or letting the keep fall into ruin.</li>
</ul>
