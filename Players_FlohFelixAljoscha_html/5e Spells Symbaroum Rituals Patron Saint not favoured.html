<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes<br />
Range: 120 ft.<br />
Components: V, S (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25
thaler) Duration: Special</p>
<p>You summon a guardian spirit to aid you, the soul of a fallen Templar
that has been given the honorable mission to once again serve one of the
Sun Godâ€™s chosen. The martyr mani- fests as a being of light. It is
normally invisible, but begins to shine when danger is close.</p>
<p>In non-combat situations, the spirit serves as your assistant. Once
on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the
servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant
can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching
things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving
food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant erforms
the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then
waits for your next command. The spirit will never venture more than 120
feet away from you. If it is somehow prevented from remaining within
that dis- tance of you, it is dispelled when the distance between the
two of you exceeds the range of the spell.</p>
<p>In combat, the spirit becomes a glowing figure with a flail made out
of light and a halo above its head. Use the following statblock for the
spirit, it acts independently. If slain, the spirit is dispelled. The
spirit counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of
experience points awarded.</p>
