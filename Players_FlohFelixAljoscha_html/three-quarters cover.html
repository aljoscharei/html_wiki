<h1 >three-quarters cover</h1>
<p>A target with <a href="three-quarters%20cover.html">three-quarters
cover</a> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has
three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an
obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick
tree trunk.</p>
