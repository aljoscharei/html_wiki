Impressionist</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +1 to Charisma<br />
You are a skilled impressionist, whether trying to impersonate a type of
person belonging to your origin or imitating a specific individual. You
gain advantage on Intelligence or Charisma checks when trying to
impersonate a type of person (for in- stance a town guardsman) rather
than a specific individual. If you have a disguise kit then you have
advantage on imperson- ating a specific individual that shares your
origin. If you are impersonating a type of person from a different
origin then you have disadvantage on the check; impersonating a specific
individual of a different origin is almost always impossible.</p>
