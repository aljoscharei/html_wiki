<h1 >Mirage Arcane</h1>
<p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Sight<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell,
and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general
shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice
like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.<br />
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where
none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add
creatures.<br />
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,
so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or
otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area
disappears immediately.<br />
Creatures with <a href="5e%20Truesight.html">5e Truesight</a> can see
through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other
elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the
illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the
illusion.</p>
