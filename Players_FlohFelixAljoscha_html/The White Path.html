<h1 >The White Path</h1>
<p>These powers focus on your interactions with spirits.<br />
- Censure Undead. As an action, you rebuke the undead. Each undead
within 30 feet that can see and/or hear you must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving
throw, it is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A
rebuked creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action,it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action. - Call Spirits.You can seek to communicate with the local
spirits and learn something useful from them.You must spend 10 minutes
preparing the area and then you invite the spirits to join you. Roll the
percentile dice, if the result is equal to or lower than twice your
mystic level you have been successful. The spirits might be able to
provide you with extensive and helpful knowledge or a magical effect
that resembles a spell of level equal to or lower than your proficiency
bonus. You must take a long or extended rest before you use this feature
again. - Purification.Use your action to touch one melee weapon. For the
next minute, that weapon does radiant damage and adds 1d4 plus your
proficiency bonus to its damage total. You gain 1 point of temporary
Corruption.</p>
