<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens Arch
Enemy</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +2 to Charisma<br />
You have, by actions or name, made an arch enemy. This individual has
devoted their existence to destroying – and in the end, taking – your
life. At least once during each adventure, the influence of the arch
enemy will show. They primarily act through others; hiring thugs or
spreading lies in the hope that others will make life difficult for the
character. Exactly who this arch enemy is, why they hate the character
and what resources are at hand, is for the player and Gamemaster to
decide. However, it cannot be someone who is easily avoided or stopped
from acting out their hatred.</p>
