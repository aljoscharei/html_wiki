<h1 >5e Water requirements
Dehydration</h1>
<p>A character needs <strong>one gallon of water per day</strong>, or
two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only
half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character
with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of
exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the
character takes two levels in either case.</p>
