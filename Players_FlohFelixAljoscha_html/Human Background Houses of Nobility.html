<h1 >Human Background Houses
of Nobility</h1>
<p>You are a member of the nobility of Ambria, however minor in station.
You might be the third or fourth child of a baronet, your parents or
grandparents granted a small measure of land for their service in the
war and as the family grows and the land-plot remains the same size,
your future becomes more uncertain. Or you might be descended from a
once-great house that no longer possesses any wealth other than your
good name and intend to restore your family to its rightful place.
You’ve decided to embrace a life of service or adventure, hoping to make
a name for yourself and win rewards just like your forebears.</p>

<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>Some members of the Houses of Nobility are still within living memory
of the service that awarded them titles. Others are ancient houses of
Alberetor, the lost kingdom of the south, and have always held positions
of privilege and pride.</p>
<p>Personality 1. I am a good friend but a fierce enemy. Do not wrong
me, or I shall have my vengeance on you. 2. I tend to be blind to the
needs of others and idealistic in my expectations. 3. I tend to
over-correct myself and stammer when in new situations. 4. I never fail
to mention my glorious family history when presenting myself. 5.
personaLity trait 6. I believe in the teachings of the Giver of Laws:
All have their rightful place under the sun, but the laborer in the
fields is as necessary to society as my service to the kingdom. 7. I use
my station to get rewards but then often pass them to others. 8. Both
the pen and the sword are weapons; you just have to choose the right
one. 9. I ask about other people’s family history, as I judge their
character by it.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Responsibility. I owe my service to my betters just the same
as the common folk owe service to me. I protect the common folk, just as
the kingdom protects me. 2. Nobility. I must serve as an example to all
of how to conduct oneself. 3. Rebuilding. I will make my house great
again, like in the olden days. 4. Trial of Arms. Prios ensures that the
just are victorious. 5. Order. The world must make sense or my
birthright is in question. 6. Fame. My name is everything, it and the
deeds I have done will outlive me.</p>
<p>Bond 1. My family name must not be tarnished; it may be all that I
have at present, but I will make it known throughout the kingdom. 2. I
place my faith in my war gear and companions. 3. I took an oath whilst
inebriated. Matters not, I must keep my word. 4. I have a favorite
relative that I admire and look up to at all times. 5. I view the Queen
as blood kin and will do anything to defend her. 6. I have been handed a
protégé to protect, and this I will do.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I did not venture forth from my family’s land by choice,
instead I embarrassed them and they made me leave. 2. I am too eager to
see every concern as right vs. wrong; good vs. evil. 3. I fear that
before the end I will let my blood and family history down. 4. I often
act haughty and feel that my station demands respect at all times. 5. I
too easily enjoy the comforts of a noble’s life. 6. I wish I was not
noble, but of common stock, with simple tastes and lower
expectations.</p>
