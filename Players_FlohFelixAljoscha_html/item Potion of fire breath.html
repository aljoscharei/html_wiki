<p>Potion, uncommon</p>
<p>After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire
at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the
fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.</p>
<p>This potionâ€™s orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the
container and wafts out whenever it is opened.</p>
<p>Notes: Damage: Fire, Damage</p>
