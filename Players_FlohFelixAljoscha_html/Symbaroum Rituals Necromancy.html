<h1 >Symbaroum Rituals Necromancy</h1>
<p>Res &lt;–Res for each answer from cadaver or grave. Re-roll but
become possessed if fail again</p>
<p>The mystic can ask a dead person a number of questions, either by
sitting next to its body (just a skull will do, as well) or its grave.
Each question demands a successful Resolute test, and the dead answers
either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ by knocking: one knock for ‘no’ and two for ‘yes’.
In the case of a failure the mystic can still try to force an answer
from the dead, but at the risk of becoming possessed by the spirit; roll
[Resolute←Resolute]. If the test is failed the mystic becomes possessed
and is forced to perform the last wish of the dead, often of a vengeful
nature. <a
