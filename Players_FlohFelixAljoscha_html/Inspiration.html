<h1 >Inspiration</h1>
<p>Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for
playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality
traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on
your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an
edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you
call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the
effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p>
<h3 >Gaining Inspiration</h3>
<p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give
in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray
your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can
earn inspiration in the game.</p>
<p>You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile
multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p>
<h3 >Using Inspiration</h3>
<p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack
roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives
you advantage on that roll.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player
for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something
exciting in the game. When another player character does something that
really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can
give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p>
