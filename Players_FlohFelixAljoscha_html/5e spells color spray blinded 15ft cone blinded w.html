<p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cone)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is
colored red, yellow, and blue)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can
effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious
creatures and creatures that can’t see).<br />
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
creature affected by this spell is <a
href="202202102106%205e%20Conditions%20Blinded.html">202202102106 5e
Conditions Blinded</a> until the spell ends. Subtract each creature’s
hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than
the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot
level above 1st.</p>
