<p>Corruption</p>
<p>The origin of Symbolism can be traced back to the destruction of the
east, and many rune crafters explain the birth of their tradition as
based on the aim to resist and/or avoid Corruption. As the east was
drained of life and became the ruined, deserted wasteland it is today,
the symbolists were busy advancing their knowledge. Not until the empire
beyond the Ravens fell and the surrounding region proved to be
devastated – the work of other mystics, according to symbolist legends –
did the founding mystics of Symbolism flee across the mountains to the
uninhabited river landscape that is today known as Vojvodar, the home of
clan Vajvod.</p>
<p>The strength of Symbolism is its resilience to Corruption. They
suffer some Corruption when a symbol is activated, but less than the
members of other traditions – as little as only one point in temporary
Corruption per activated symbol. Symbolism’s weakness is that it is
slow; a symbolist trades their protection from Corruption for the time
it takes to craft the symbols. However, the rituals of Symbolism
function just like the rituals of other traditions.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
<p>Symbolism requires the creation of intricate and complex runes that
contain and bind their magical power. Thus, a symbolist uses
Intelligence for the spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells
from the Wizard tradition list. <a

Wizard Spells</a> However, you do not cast most magic as a normal
mystic, preparing and activating runes instead. You do cast cantrips and
rituals as normal. You can favor cantrips as normal, but you use runes
instead of normal spells otherwise.</p>
<p>Each rune is equivalent to casting one spell at a chosen spell level
(a symbolist cannot prepare a rune at a higher level than their maximum
spell level). When the rune is activated, the spell is cast and you gain
temporary Corruption equal to the spell’s prepared level. An unfavored
spell costs double the prepared level. You decide the spell’s effective
level while preparing the rune and cannot change the spell level when
you activate the rune. You can activate the rune multiple times.</p>
<p>example: Thurnia, a symbolist, prepares hold monster, normally a 5th
level spell. She decides to create a rune as if it were cast at 8th
level (the maximum she can, as she is 15th level). When she activates
the rune, it will affect four creatures and she will gain 8 temporary
Corruption.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a long or extended rest, you must choose one of
your runes to lose potency. That rune cannot be used to cast a spell
until it is prepared again. At the beginning of any rest, you can choose
to destroy one or more runes, in order to prepare different runes.</p>
<p>Runes can only be prepared during a rest. You may prepare - four
runes during an extended rest, - two runes during a long rest and - one
rune during a short rest. You cannot have more active runes than twice
your proficiency bonus.</p>
