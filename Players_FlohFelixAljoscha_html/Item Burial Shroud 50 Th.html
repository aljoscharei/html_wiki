<h1 >Item Burial Shroud 50 Th</h1>
<p>The spiritualists among the witches often wear a shroud over their
head when contacting the spir- its of the dead, since this makes the
spirits calmer and allows for a deeper connection. A mystic using such
an artifact gains advantage on one saving throw per long rest involving
the spirits of the dead.</p>
