<p><em>8th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least

<p>Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in
a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius
when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have
advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on
attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a
fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the
aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.</p>
