<h1 >5e Surprise</h1>
<p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the
trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,
unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the
other.</p>
<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be
stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM
compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the
passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.
Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at
the start of the encounter.</p>
<p>If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first
turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends.
A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members
aren’t.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>There is no surprise round There is no hostile action before rolling
init Surprise is a condition for individuals and not a state of the
game. </p>
<p>Surprise with connected rules:</p>
<p>Sage advice compendium adds:</p>
<p>Does surprise happen outside the initiative order as a special
surprise round? No, here’s how surprise works. The first step of any
combat is this: the DM determines whether anyone in the combat is
surprised (reread “Com-bat Step by Step” on page 189 of the Player’s
Handbook). This determination happens only once during a fight and only
at the beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can’t be
surprised again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal
benefits from being unseen (see “<a
href="5e%20Unseen%20Attackers%20and%20Targets.html">5e Unseen Attackers
and Targets</a>” on page 194 of the Player’s Handbook). To be surprised,
you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes
being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability,
such as the gelatinous cube’s Transparent trait, that makes it
ex-ceptionally surprising.</p>
<p><strong>You can be surprised even if your companions aren’t, and you
aren’t surprised if even one of your foes fails to catch you
unawares.</strong></p>
<p>If anyone is surprised, no actions are taken yet. First, initiative
is rolled as normal. Then, the first round of combat starts, and the
unsurprised combatants act in initiative order. A surprised creature
can’t move or take an action or a reaction until its first turn ends
(remember that being unable to take an action also means you can’t take
a bonus action). In effect, a surprised creature skips its first turn in
a fight. Once that turn ends, the creature is no longer surprised. In
short, activity in a combat is always ordered by initia-tive, whether or
not someone is surprised, and after the first round of combat has
passed, surprise is no longer a factor. You can still try to hide from
your foes and gain the benefits conferred by being hidden, but you don’t
deprive your foes of their turns when you do so.</p>
<p>The three kinds of ability checks are very important for surprise:
Standard ability checks Group checks: average of checks needs to be
above dc Passive checks</p>
<p>Which kind of check you ise for surprise is paramount in determining
if surprise is linely Standard ability check: If individual checks for
the group trying to be stealthy, then one of the stealthers is likely to
fail so that the opponents are not surprised </p>
<p>Group check:</p>
<p>If group check then the stealthers are much likelier to succeed</p>
<p>Passive stealth checks:</p>
<p>Alternative house rule: roll one check for stealthers but at
disadvantage because there are so many Choosing the type of check
determines the likelyhood</p>
<p>If surprise is likely then use group checks or passive checks for the
stealthers </p>
<p>Lighting:</p>
<p>Darkvision in darkness vision is as if in low light so disadvantage
at perception checks, or passive -5</p>
<p>If any group is using light then the other group will probably not be
surprised.</p>
<p>Dont use surprise too often but rather say that individuals are
unseen so the opponent has disadvantage. Surprise is extremely powerful
because of action economy</p>
<p>Surprise is unlikely if groups But one particular individual monster
can surprise. And if is is one on one the surprised on looses its round,
so you can skip the RAW but saying alway roll init</p>
<p>Lighting stealth perception.</p>
