>Wizard
are clearly the most powerful spellcasters. Wizardry exists only since
Kullinan and the founding of the ordo magica. Thus you cannot start as a
wizard. You have to earn being allowed into the ordo. So there is no
classless option here. You need to be a memeber of ordo magica to learn
spells up to and including level 6.</h1>

<h2 >Corruption</h2>
<p>According to Ordo Magica, Corruption is largely misunderstood, thanks
to the sermons of hot-headed theurgs and the fairy tales of witches. It
all comes down to a regulated response; a reaction that occurs when a
mystic uses their power to affect nature. This is not that different
from what happens when some-one jumps off the stern of a boat,
simultaneously pushing the boat forward with the same amount of force
that goes into the jump. If the jumper is reckless, he will drop into
the water; if the jumper is careful, he will land on the dock with dry
shoes.</p>
<h2 >Spellcasting Ability</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizards rely on the philosophy and knowledge taught to them during
their time with Ordo Magica to understand the ancient secrets of the
world. You use <strong>Intelligence</strong> as your spellcasting
ability modifier. You learn spells from the Wizard tradition list <a
