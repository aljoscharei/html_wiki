<h1 >5e Exploration</h1>
<p>This section provides guidance for running exploration, especially
travel, tracking, and visibility.</p>
<h3 >Using a Map</h3>
<p>Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, you can use a map
to follow their progress as you relate the details of their travels. In
a dungeon, tracking movement on a map lets you describe the branching
passages, doors, chambers, and other features the adventurers encounter
as they go, and gives the players the opportunity to choose their own
path. Similarly, a wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and
other features that might guide the characters on their travels — or
lead them astray.</p>
<p>The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on maps of different
scales. The table shows how much distance on a map the adventurers can
cover on foot in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the [travel
paces](. Characters moving at a normal pace can walk about 24 miles in a
day. <a

<h3 >Special Travel Pace</h3>
<p>The rules on travel pace in the [Player’s Handbook]( assume that a
group of travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the
individual members’ walking speeds. The difference between walking
speeds can be significant during combat, but during an overland journey,
the difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the
faster ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler’s quickness is
matched by another traveler’s endurance.</p>
<p>A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring through the air on a
[carpet of flying](, translate that speed into travel rates using the
following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to your speed times
10.</li>
<li>In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to your speed
divided by 10.</li>
<li>For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by the number
of hours traveled (typically 8 hours).</li>
<li>For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third.</li>
<li>For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a character under the effect of a [wind walk]( spell
gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, the character can move
3,000 feet at a normal pace, 4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at
a slow pace. The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an
hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character to travel 160,
240, or 320 miles in a day.</p>
<p>Similarly, a [phantom steed]( spell creates a magical mount with a
speed of 100 feet that doesn’t tire like a real horse. A character on a
phantom steed can cover 1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333
feet at a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the
character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles.</p>
<h3 >Visibility Outdoors</h3>
<p><a
href="Encounter%20Distance%20Spot%20Distances%20Visibility">Encounter
Distance Spot Distances Visibility</a></p>
<p>When traveling outdoors, characters can see about <strong>2
miles</strong> in any direction on a clear day, or until the point where
trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. Rain normally cuts
maximum visibility down to 1 mile, and fog can cut it down to between
100 and 300 feet.</p>
<p>On a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they are atop a
mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down on the area
around them from a height.</p>
<h3 >Noticing Other Creatures</h3>
<p>While exploring, characters might encounter other creatures. An
important question in such a situation is who notices whom.</p>
<p>Indoors, whether the sides can see one another usually depends on the
configuration of rooms and passageways. Vision might also be limited by
light sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, weather,
and time of day. Creatures can be more likely to hear one another before
they see anything. <a
href="Encounter%20Distance%20Spot%20Distances%20Visibility#Audible%20Distance"></a></p>
<p>If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice
each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another.
Otherwise, compare the <a href="5e%20Skills%20Stealth.html">5e Skills
Stealth</a>. ### Tracking</p>
<p>Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of
other creatures — or other creatures might track the adventurers! To
track, one or more creatures must succeed on a Wisdom <a
href="5e%20Skills%20Survival.html">5e Skills Survival</a> check. You might
require trackers to make a new check in any of the following
circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short or long
rest.</li>
<li>The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows no
tracks.</li>
<li>The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes
tracking harder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a
creature’s passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks
are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing
along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more
challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail.
Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow.
In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that
tracking is impossible.</p>
<p>The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if
you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the
difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there’s more
than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being
followed passes through a well-trafficked area.</p>
<p>On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to
find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10
minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour
outdoors.</p>
