<p>School of Conjuration</p>
<p>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures
out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or
summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself
across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an
instant.</p>
<h1 >Conjuration Savant</h1>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h1 >Minor Conjuration</h1>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your
action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground
in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This
object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10
pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have
seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5
feet.</p>
<p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again,
or if it takes or deals any damage.</p>
<h1 >Benign Transposition</h1>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can
choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium
creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping
places. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or
higher.</p>
<h1 >Focused Conjuration</h1>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration
spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking
damage.</p>
<h1 >Durable Summons</h1>
<p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a
conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p>
