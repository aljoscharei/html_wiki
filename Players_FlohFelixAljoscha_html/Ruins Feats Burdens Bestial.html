<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens Bestial</h1>
<p>• Bonus: +2 to Constitution<br />
You have a bestial appearance, in the form of one (or a few) conspicuous
traits – jakaar eyes, aboar tusks, lindworm scales on arms and neck, or
something else arousing fear and disgust.</p>
<p>Concealing the traits requires you to pass a DC 10 Charis- ma saving
throw. If the save is failed, you have disadvantage on all Charisma
(Deception, Performance or Persuasion) checks. However, the bestial
exterior grants advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. As soon as
they can, those subjected to your intimidation efforts – whether or not
it is successful – will report you to the Town Watch (or similar
authorities) as a suspected abomination.</p>
