<h1 >Item Sun Mask 50 Th</h1>
<p>The sun masks of the theurgs bestow spiritual warmth to the
cold-hearted and spread light where no other light can reach. Worn by a
theurg, it can also assist in combat against undead and abominations.
The mask radiates light around the wearer as if it is a torch; in the
lightâ€™s radius (60 ft.) the theurg can invoke its power to provide
disadvantage on saving throws against banishing spells or turning undead
once for each long rest.</p>
