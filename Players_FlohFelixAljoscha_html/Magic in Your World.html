<h1 >Magic in Your World</h1>
<p>In most D&amp;D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous and
sometimes frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most
people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the
cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes,
the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods,
creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the
secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with
the exploits of those who wield it.</p>
<p>What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether
they know characters who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet
might not have seen true magic used for generations and speak in
whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby
woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting, the
Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These
arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the order’s members
can profit from selling their services.</p>
<p>Some D&amp;D settings have more magic in them than others. On Athas,
the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic is a hated
practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas’s magic lies
in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, magic is
as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile houses sell magic
items and services to anyone who can afford them. People purchase
tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic.</p>
<p>Consider these questions when fitting magic into your world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magic is
rare?</li>
<li>How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are
those who can cast high-level spells?</li>
<li>How rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have
supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from
everyday to exotic?</li>
<li>How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use
magic and protect themselves from it?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For
example, if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron,
then authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and
use the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn’t only
possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep
well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky
situations.</p>
<h3 >Restrictions on Magic</h3>
<p>Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic.
Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official
permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects
are rare, with protections against magic being the exception.</p>
<p>Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime
to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow
invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate
others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will.
Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A local
ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such as
shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated)
and enact a law restricting that type of magic.</p>
<h3 >Schools of Magic</h3>
<p>The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration,
illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it’s up to you to determine what
those schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options
suggest the existence of magic-using organizations in the world — bardic
colleges and druid circles — which are up to you to flesh out.</p>
<p>You could decide that no formal structures like these exist in your
world. Wizards (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player
character learns from a single mentor and never meets another character
of the same class, in which case wizards would learn their school
specialization without any formal training.</p>
<p>However, if magic is more common, academies can be the embodiments of
the schools of magic. These institutions have their own hierarchies,
traditions, regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros the
necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As
a sign of his high standing within its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear
the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these
robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who know of the
cabal. This recognition could be a boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal
of Thar-Zad has a fearsome reputation.</p>
<p>If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, bardic
colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the guidelines for
organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player character
necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while a
bard seeks increasing renown within the College of Mac-Fuirmidh.</p>
<h3 >Teleportation Circles</h3>
<p>The presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps
cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells
such as plane shift <a
href="plane%20shift%208%20friends%20also%20banish%20wc.html">plane shift 8
friends also banish wc</a>, teleport, and teleportation circle connect
with these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the
headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations.
However, since every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry
into a city, they’re guarded by military and magical protection.</p>
<p>As you design a fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles
it might contain and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If
the adventurers commonly return to their home base by means of a
teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for plot developments in
your campaign. What do the adventurers do if they arrive in a
teleportation circle and find all the familiar wards disabled and guards
lying in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an argument
between two feuding priests at the temple? Adventure ensues!</p>
<h3 >Bringing Back the Dead</h3>
<p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material
Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane
where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature didn’t worship a
deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment.
Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that
plane and returning it to its body.</p>
<p>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to
be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using
raise dead <a href="raise_dead%2010%20days%20c.html">raise_dead 10 days
c</a> or resurrection <a
href="resurrection%20max%20100%20y%20dead%20c.html">resurrection max 100 y
dead c</a> to restore the slain character to life.</p>
<p>A soul can’t be returned to life if it doesn’t wish to be. A soul
knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character
attempting to revive it and might refuse to return on that basis. For
example, if the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a high
priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might
not wish to be raised from the dead by her. Any attempts she makes to
revive him automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm
to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick his soul, such
as duping a good cleric into raising him and then capturing him once he
is alive again.</p>
