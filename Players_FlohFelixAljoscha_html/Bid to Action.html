<h1 >Bid to Action</h1>
<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can spur others to act quickly. When a
creatureâ€™s turn ends, use your reaction to nominate a friendly creature
to have its turn next instead of acting on its normal initiative count.
The creature must not have already taken its turn yet this round and
retains its original initiative count for future rounds.</p>
