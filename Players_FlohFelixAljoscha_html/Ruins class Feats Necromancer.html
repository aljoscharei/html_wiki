The Spirit World is the outer realm of the world, where the dead journey
towards their final rest – if they are not dis- turbed by a necromancer
on the way. Necromancers can force the spirits of the outer realm to
return, in order to relay their secrets or to occupy a dead body and
serve the death mage as a dragoul or some other undead being. An
understanding of the mechanics of death also gives the nec- romancer
access to ghastly powers and rituals.</p>
