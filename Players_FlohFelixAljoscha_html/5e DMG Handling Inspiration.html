<h1 >5e DMG Handling Inspiration</h1>
<p><a href="Inspiration.html">Inspiration</a></p>
<p>EVERY PC GETS INSPIRATION AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SESSION</p>
<p>Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and
risk-taking. As explained in the [Player’s Handbook]( gives a character
an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more
than one inspiration at a time.</p>
<h4 >Awarding Inspiration</h4>
<p>Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your
campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a
key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section,
remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more
enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that
make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about
once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration
more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might
use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it
with each campaign.</p>
<p>Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior
in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group’s
preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type
of actions fit in with your campaign’s style or genre? Your answers to
those questions help determine when you award inspiration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Roleplaying.</em></strong> Using inspiration to reward
roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player
with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do
something that is consistent with the character’s personality trait,
flaw, or bond. The character’s action should be notable in some way. It
might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make
everyone at the table laugh. In essence, you reward the player for
roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone
else.</p>
<p>Take into account each player’s roleplaying style, and try not to
favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable
speaking in an accent and adopting her character’s mannerisms, but Paul
feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his
character’s attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the
other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good
effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heroism.</em></strong> You can use inspiration to
encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally
hurl himself over a balcony to land in the midst of a pack of hungry
ghouls, but you can reward the character’s daring maneuver with
inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to
embrace swashbuckling action.</p>
<p>This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed
heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent
after a d20 roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration
into a cushion against failure — and a guarantee that it comes into play
only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes
risky tactics less daunting.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Reward for Victory.</em></strong> Some DMs prefer to
play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires
a DM’s judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like
a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that’s your
style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters
achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence
and energy.</p>
<p>Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the
characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to
achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the
campaign.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genre Emulation.</em></strong> Inspiration is a handy
tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this
approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws,
and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a
campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional
flaw: “I can’t resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings
that he or she is nothing but trouble.” If the characters agree to help
a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web
of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.</p>
<p>Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can’t help but
spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably
also go off alone when they shouldn’t. If the party splits up, consider
giving each character inspiration.</p>
<p>A sensible person would avoid the noble’s intrigues and the haunted
house, but in film noir or horror, we’re not dealing with sensible
people; we’re dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story.
For this approach to work, create a list of your genre’s main
conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins,
talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing
those conventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Players and Inspiration.</em></strong> Remember that a
player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even
like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively
when to spend it on a roll. It’s best to let players award their
inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about
following certain guidelines, particularly if you’re trying to reinforce
conventions of a certain genre.</p>
<h4 >When Do You Award
Inspiration?</h4>
<p>Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to
award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage
specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering
options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also
means players don’t know whether their decisions will earn them
inspiration. It also means the player can’t spend the inspiration on the
act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it
or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works
best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where
the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they
want.</p>
<p>Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides
clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players
or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works
great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre
emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn’t as
important as weaving a compelling tale together.</p>
<p>Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your
first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the
least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel
as if you are being manipulative.</p>
<h4 >Tracking Inspiration</h4>
<p>A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has
inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token
Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration.
When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands
it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone
else, the d20 can go to that other person.</p>
<h4 >Ignoring Inspiration</h4>
<p>Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a
layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying,
and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don’t need
incentives like inspiration.</p>
<p>If you choose to ignore inspiration, you’re telling the players that
your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It’s a
good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing
an impartial role as a rules arbiter.</p>
<h4 >Variant: Only Players
Award Inspiration</h4>
<p>As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can
lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you
can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During
every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A
player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding
inspiration.</p>
<p>This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the
chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make
sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.</p>
<p>This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story.
It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in
key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying
or whatever other criteria the group has established.</p>
<p>In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more
than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards
inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later
in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give
advantage to any foe of the player characters. There’s no limit to the
number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration
carries over from one session to the next.</p>
