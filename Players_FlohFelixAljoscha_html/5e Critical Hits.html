<h1 >5e Critical Hits</h1>
<p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the
attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice
twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.
To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p>
<p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for
the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability
modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the
rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>
<p>The above rule leads to underwhelmung Crits. Alternative: Roll dmg
and double including modifiers</p>

<li>max dmg plus the damage dice</li>
<li>double the rolled dmg</li>
