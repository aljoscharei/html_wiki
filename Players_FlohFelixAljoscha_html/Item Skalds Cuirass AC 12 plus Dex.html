<h1 >Item Skalds Cuirass AC 12
plus Dex</h1>
<p>Skald’s Cuirass. Troll singers are often warrior poets and many wear
a flexible armor of woven cloth- or leather- strips, strengthened with
protective harmonies. The Skald’s Cuirass is durable without hampering
the wear- ers’ movement, making it popular among other groups as well.
For instance, wealthy duelists in Yndaros often color their cuirasses in
personal colors, so that they can be recognized from afar.</p>
