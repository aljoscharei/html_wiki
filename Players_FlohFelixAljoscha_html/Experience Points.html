<p>Experience points (XP) fuel level advancement for player characters
and are most often the reward for completing combat encounters.</p>
<p>Each monster has an XP value based on its challenge rating. When
adventurers defeat one or more monsters — typically by killing, routing,
or capturing them — they divide the total XP value of the monsters
evenly among themselves. If the party received substantial assistance
from one or more NPCs, count those NPCs as party members when dividing
up the XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual
characters receive fewer XP.)</p>
<p>Chapter 3, <a href="5e%20DMG%2003%20Creating%20Adventures">5e DMG 03
Creating Adventures</a> provides guidelines for designing combat
encounters using experience points.</p>
<h3 >Absent Characters</h3>
<p>Typically, adventurers earn experience only for encounters they
participate in. If a player is absent for a session, the player’s
character misses out on the experience points.</p>
<p>Over time, you might end up with a level gap between the characters
of players who never miss a session and characters belonging to players
who are more sporadic in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A
gap of two or three levels between different characters in the same
party isn’t going to ruin the game for anyone. Some DMs treat XP as a
reward for participating in the game, and keeping up with the rest of
the party is good incentive for players to attend as many sessions as
possible.</p>
<p>As an alternative, give absent characters the same XP that the other
characters earned each session, keeping the group at the same level. Few
players will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just because
they know they’ll receive XP for it even if they don’t show up.</p>
<h3 >Noncombat Challenges</h3>
<p>You decide whether to award experience to characters for overcoming
challenges outside combat. If the adventurers complete a tense
negotiation with a baron, forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly
dwarves, or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might decide
that they deserve an XP reward.</p>
<p>As a starting point, use the rules for building combat encounters in
<a href="5e%20DMG%2003%20Creating%20Adventures">5e DMG 03 Creating
Adventures</a> to gauge the difficulty of the challenge. Then award the
characters XP as if it had been a combat encounter of the same
difficulty, but only if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of
failure.</p>
<h3 >Milestones</h3>
<p>You can also award XP when characters complete significant
milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or
challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the
adventure.</li>
<li>Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to
the adventure.</li>
<li>Reaching an important destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a
minor milestone as an easy encounter.</p>
<p>If you want to reward your players for their progress through an
adventure with something more than XP and treasure, give them additional
small rewards at milestone points. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.</li>
<li>Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level spell slot.</li>
<li>Characters can regain the use of magic items that have had their
limited uses expended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Level Advancement without XP</h3>
<p>You can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate
of character advancement. Advance characters based on how many sessions
they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters
gain a level.</p>
<p>This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your
campaign doesn’t include much combat, or includes so much combat that
tracking XP becomes tiresome.</p>

<h4 >Story-Based Advancement</h4>
<p>When you let the story of the campaign drive advancement, you award
levels when adventurers accomplish significant goals in the
campaign.</p>
