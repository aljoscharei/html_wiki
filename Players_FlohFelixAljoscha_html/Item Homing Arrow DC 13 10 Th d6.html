<h1 >Item Homing Arrow DC 13 10 Th
d6</h1>
<p>The alchemist marinates an arrow in homing essences, thereby creating
an arrow that flies past other combatants, i.e.Â it does not require a
clear line of sight and ignores cover effects. However, the archer must
be able to see some portion of the target and must succeed at a regular
attack roll to successfully hit it.</p>
