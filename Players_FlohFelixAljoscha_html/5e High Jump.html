<h1 >5e High Jump</h1>
<p>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet
equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot
immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can
jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the
jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might
allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you
normally can.</p>
<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the
jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of
the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.</p>
