<h1 >5e Order of Combat Reaction</h1>
<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a
special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a
trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.
The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most
common type of reaction.</p>
<p>When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start
of your next turn. <strong>If the reaction interrupts another creature’s
turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the
reaction.</strong></p>
