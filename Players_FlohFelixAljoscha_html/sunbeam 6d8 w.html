<p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (60-foot line)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a magnifying glass)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a
5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8
radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful
save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell.
Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br />
You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until
the spell ends.<br />
For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It
sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional
30 feet. This light is sunlight.</p>
