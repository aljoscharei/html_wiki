<p>This horribly sickening elixir was once used by mystics wanting to
hide just how close they were to becoming thoroughly corrupt, making it
a welcomed ad- dition to all sorcerersâ€™ collections of mystical
decoctions. Whoever manages to force down the sludge distorts their
shadow for 24 hours, making it appear as if their Corrup- tion total is
2d4 points lower.</p>
