<h1 >Loremaster</h1>
<p>At 3rd level, the character is educated and well-versed in the ways
of the world: its cultures, its history, languages and artifacts. For
centuries heroes, monsters and kingdoms have come and gone, leaving
behind powerful items and secret texts. This ability represents
knowledge about such objects. Through extensive studies a character with
this ability knows not only the story of an object but also its
properties and applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>At 3rd level, - you can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation)
check to determine the properties of a magic item. On a success, if it
is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether
it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You
learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If
the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. The
DC is dependent on the kind of magic item: common (DC 10), uncommon (DC
13), rare (DC 16), very rare (DC 19), legendary (DC 22). This replaces
the identify spell in DnD <a
