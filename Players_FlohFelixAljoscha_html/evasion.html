<h1 >evasion</h1>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of
certain area effects, such as an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take
only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the
saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
