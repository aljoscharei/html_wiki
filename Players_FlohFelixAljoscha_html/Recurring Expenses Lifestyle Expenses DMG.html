<p>Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular
lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring
income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own
businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany
these ventures.</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for adventurers — especially after 10th level — to
gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property.
They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it
in a lucky draw from a <a
href="deck_of_many_things">deck_of_many_things</a> , or acquire it by
other means.</p>
<p>The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any
such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn’t included here
because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the Player’s
Handbook <a href="Lifestyle%20Expenses.html">Lifestyle Expenses</a> .)
Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that
adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a
steward who can make payments in the party’s absence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Total Cost per Day.</em></strong> The cost includes
everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running
smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns
money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting
tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in
the table.</p>
<p><strong><em>Skilled and Untrained Hirelings.</em></strong> The
Player’s Handbook explains the difference between a skilled hireling and
an untrained one. <a href="5e%20Hireling.html">5e Hireling</a></p>

<h4 >Businesses</h4>
<p>An adventurer-owned business can earn enough money to cover its own
maintenance costs. However, the owner needs to periodically ensure that
everything is running smoothly by tending to the business between
adventures. See the information on running a business in Downtme
Activities <a href="5e%20Downtime.html">5e Downtime</a> in this chapter.

<h4 >Garrisons</h4>
<p>Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the <a

the Monster Manual to defend them. Roadside inns, outposts and forts,
palaces, and temples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the <a

warriors make up the bulk of a property’s skilled hirelings. <a
