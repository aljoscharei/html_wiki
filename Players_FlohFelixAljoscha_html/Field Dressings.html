<h1 >Field Dressings</h1>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can help wounded allies during a short or
long rest. If you or any friendly creatures regain hit points at the end
of the rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures
regains an extra 1d6 hit points. The extra hit points increase when you
reach certain lev- els in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at
11th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>
