<p>Tradition: Witchcraft<br />
The mystic binds itself to a beast. This beast is not much smarter than
others of its kind, but is fiercely loyal to the mystic and the bond
between them is made up of mystical energies â€“ they are soul mates. The
spiritual bond is so strong that the two can communicate telepathically;
the mystic can command the familiar from a distance and also experience
whatever the familiar perceives with its senses. The depth of this union
also makes it possible for the two to share wounds. If the familiar is
wounded the mystic can choose to suffer half of the damage, or if the
mystic is wounded half of the damage can be transferred to the familiar.
The player decides when damage should be shared in this way. There is
also a downside to the mystical bond: should the familiar die the mystic
suffers 1D8 points of damage, ignoring Armor. The familiar is managed by
the player as if it was an additional character. It gains Experience
like a player character and loses it if it dies, just like a
character.</p>
