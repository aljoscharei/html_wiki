<h1 >Sunburst</h1>
<p><em>8th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fire and a piece of
sunstone)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point
you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6
radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it
takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and
oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br />
A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw
at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer
blinded.<br />
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

<p>Sunburst does a lot of things, but does each of them worse than
competitive other options do. This spell is just another in the massive
suite of area of effect d6 damaging spells, but with the upside of
having a blind on it. For one less d6 damage than up-casting a 3rd level
spell, you get a potential blind and a bit of extra area.</p>
<p>How good is the blinded condition, then? This will typically look
like imposing disadvantage on attack rolls from the affected creatures
while bolstering attack rolls against them for a round. What’s neat and
somewhat useful here is this makes an area of effect spell function well
against single entities with low Constitutions as well as bulk amounts
of enemies of all sizes. It is slightly more flexible than either option
normally would be, albeit at the massive cost of the effect being
substantially worse than each other’s respective top end. <a

spells dominate monster mind control any cr w not favoured</a> gives you
control over the target, a MASSIVE upgrade over a blind, and <a
href="incendiary%20cloud%20aoe%2010d8%20dmg%20w.html">incendiary cloud aoe
10d8 dmg w</a> does both more damage the round you cast it and sticks
around for subsequent damage afterwards. If you’re considering casting
it on one creature, <a

of death 7d8plus30 dmg zombie w not favoured</a> is dealing nearly
double the damage, and is a level lower. <a
href="sunbeam%206d8%20w.html">sunbeam 6d8 w</a> is two levels lower,
offers you subsequent actions to hit more creatures and get more blinds,
and while the initial damage is lower, it has even more flexible use
cases. You can get all of the individual parts of Sunburst elsewhere
better, just not specifically all of the parts combined.</p>
<p>Sunburst also suffers from most of the issues upper tier
advantage/disadvantage effects suffer from in that it won’t meaningfully
add anything to moments where you’d already have that condition. If
you’ve got a Mastermind rogue helping every round to bolster single
important attacks, or have any of the lower level effects like <a
href="darkness%20negative%20light%20%20w.html">darkness negative light
w</a>or <a
href="blindnessdeafness%20not%20favoured%20wc.html">blindnessdeafness not
favoured wc</a> that provide the same disability, spending an 8th level
slot for the end result is pretty bad. <a
href="faerie%20fire%2060%20ft%20adv%20for%20attacks%20on%20creat%20d.html">faerie
fire 60 ft adv for attacks on creat d</a> is a 1st level spell that
applies advantage to attacks against groups of creatures, and doesn’t
grant them subsequent saves to end the effect early. Sunburst does
decent enough damage, and has a potentially good effect in a vacuum, but
its cost, I just don’t think it brings something unique enough to the
table to justify it on your spell list.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for a decent damage option that also has a
free blind attached to it, Sunburst is that. It excels in the niche
environment where you’re facing a large quantity of creatures with high
hit points that you’d want to blind in a massive area. Fun fact, that is
rare to non-existent in the game. By the time you’re getting 8th level
slots, I’d recommend going for spells that solve problems you can’t
already solve. Sunburst just doesn’t do that. You already have access to
effects that can blind at lower level costs, and you likely have access
to better damage spell options than this. If you want both still, this
is it. Otherwise, try out something a lot less fair.</p>
