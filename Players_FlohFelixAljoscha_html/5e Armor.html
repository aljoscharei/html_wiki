<h1 >Armor</h1>
<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different
cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason,
adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from
leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other
kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly
available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three
categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors
supplement their armor with a shield.</p>
<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the
common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p>

the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks.</p>

Armor</h2>
<p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s
category.</p>
<p><strong>Don</strong> This is the time it takes to put on armor. You
benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the
suit of armor.</p>
<p><strong>Doff</strong> This is the time it takes to take off armor. If
you have help, reduce this time by half.</p>
