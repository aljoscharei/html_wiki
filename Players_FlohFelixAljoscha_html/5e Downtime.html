<h1 >5e Downtime</h1>
<p>description: Rules and information governing player time between
adventures (downtime) from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference
Document).</p>
<h1 >Between Adventures</h1>
<p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils,
adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next
adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks,
such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their
hard-earned gold.</p>
<p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with
little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM
might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow
you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At
other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is
passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>

<h2 >Downtime Activities</h2>
<p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing
during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration,
but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be
spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not
need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days
to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time,
or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>
<p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible.
If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an
activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>
