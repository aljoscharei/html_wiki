<p>Choose a creature within range. If it is unwilling, it can make a
Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect. When you take damage from
a weapon attack or a spell effect you divide the damage done between you
and the creature (in the case of an odd damage total, you take the extra
point of damage). An unwilling creature can make another Constitution
saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect.</p>
