<h1 >Trapper Monster Hunter</h1>
<p>At 3rd level, you become proficient with alchemical and mechanical
traps. You can use your action during combat to deploy a mechanical trap
within 5 feet of your position. You are never threatened by the trap but
treat movement within 5 feet of a trapped area as difficult terrain. You
can use your action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to
disable a mechanical trap. The DC is given on page 186.</p>
<p>At 6th level, you can use your action during combat to deploy a
mechanical or alchemical trap within 5 feet of your position. You are
never threatened by the trap but treat movement within 5 feet of a
trapped area as difficult terrain. You can use your action to make a
Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to disable a mechanical or alchemical
trap.</p>
<p>At 9th level, if you have time before a combat, you can prepare an
area with improvised traps. Each trap requires 10 minutes of preparation
and does 1d8 damage (bludgeoning, piercing or slashing, depending on the
trap design). See page 186 for rules on traps.</p>
