<p>At 3rd level, your devotion to Prios and understanding of his power
has suffused your very muscles with magical power. When you make a
successful melee attack roll you can choose to gain Corruption just as
if you were casting a spell that you know. Roll for temporary Corruption
as normal and add three times that amount in radiant damage to your
attack.</p>
<p>example: Brinana is a 3rd level Templar fighting a Blighted enemy.
She can cast up to second level spells and decides to unleash that power
when her sword strikes her adversary. She gains 4 (1d4 + 2) temporary
Corruption and does 12 points of radiant damage in addition to her
weapon damage.</p>
