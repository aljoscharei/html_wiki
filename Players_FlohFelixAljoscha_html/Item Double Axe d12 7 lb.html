<p>Double-axe. The barbarian double-axe (not to be confused with the
more common pole axe with its single-edged axe head) is aptly named
after its twin axe heads and is presumed to be a legacy from the fallen
Symbaroum. In those days the double-axe was a weapon as well as a sym-
bol of status and standing. Even though the knowledge of metallurgy has
dwindled since the fall of Symbaroum these powerful weapons can still be
forged, often made for particularly prominent warriors. Ambrians
consider the double-axe crude and savage, fit for barbarians and few
else, but its shape is well known because of its sim- ilarity to the
royal rune, Labrys.</p>
