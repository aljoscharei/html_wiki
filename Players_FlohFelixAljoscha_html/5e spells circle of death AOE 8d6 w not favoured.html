<p>circLe of Death*</p>
<p>6th-level necromancy</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br />
Range: 150 ft.<br />
Components: V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black</p>
<p>pearl worth at least 250 thaler) Duration: Concentration, up to 1
minute</p>
<p>A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere
from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a
Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 7th lev- el or higher,
the damage increases by 2d6 for each level above 6th.</p>
<p>The Forums say: A 60’ radius spell hits <em>over four hundred 5x5
squares</em>. (Technically, it hits 452 squares, but I’m allowing for
all the inefficiencies and “must cover at least 50%” rules which cause a
decent amount of loss at the edges.) Compare that to a
<em>fireball</em>, which covers an ideal area of 50ish squares. Are
there a lot of situations where you <em>need</em> 8x-9x the area of a
Fireball spell? Probably not. But I can at least see some benefit for
stomping on such a large area.</p>
<p><strong>Circle of Death, really, is a bad guy spell.</strong> For
commoners and guardsmen, having only 1-3 HD apiece, 28 damage pretty
much IS death. So what if it’s sub par for most nasties PCs will face?
It’s GREAT for a cackling madboy wizard delighting in the suffering of
innocents.</p>
<p>That said, it also has <em>some</em> uses in dealing with a huge
enemy onslaught. Remember that 5e expects you to continue using CR 1,
1/2, or even 1/4 creatures at 12th level and beyond; for many such
creatures, while this spell might not be instant death or even a killing
blow, it’ll hurt like hell and just one more hit will take out a lot of
things (and at this point, Fighters are getting a third attack, and most
other melee classes hit extra hard with theirs, so they’re quite good at
this sort of ‘cleanup’).</p>
