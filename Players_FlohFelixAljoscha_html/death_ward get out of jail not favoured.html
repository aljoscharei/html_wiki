<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from
death.<br />
The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of
taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell
ends.<br />
If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an
effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that
effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.</p>
