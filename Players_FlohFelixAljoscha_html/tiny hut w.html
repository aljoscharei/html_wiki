<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small crystal bead)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around
and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if
you leave its area. Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit
inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger
creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the
dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other
creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and
other magical effects canâ€™t extend through the dome or be cast through
it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless
of the weather outside.<br />
Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit
or dark.</p>
<p>The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it
is transparent from the inside.</p>
