<p>Bolas. This weapon is used in Davokar when someone wants to capture
the prey alive; or in order to slow down a target before moving in for
the kill. The bolas are made of two or more weights tied together with
ropes that, together, are hurled at the target’s legs or arms in order
to hinder movement. Normally, such a weapon is thrown at the opponent’s
legs and if the attack roll is successful, the target becomes prone and
restrained. It is harder to hit the arms of the target – this requires
an attack roll at regular range with disadvantage. On a success the
target cannot use their arms. Removing the bolas requires an action to
attempt a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check.</p>
