<p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue,
green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the
spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving
throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light
in a 10-foot radius.<br />
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has <a
href="advantage%20in%20melee%20in%205e%20and%20Symbaroum.html">advantage
in melee in 5e and Symbaroum</a> if the attacker can see it, and the
affected creature or object canâ€™t benefit from being invisible.</p>
<p>As the Advantage also gives Scoundrela the opportunity to use
<strong>Backstab</strong>, this should mean, that the target is
distracted somehow. Painful? <a
