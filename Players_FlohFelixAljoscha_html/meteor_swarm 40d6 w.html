<h1 >Meteor Swarm</h1>
<p><em>9th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points
you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere
centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw.
The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and
20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is
affected only once.<br />
The spell damages objects in the area and <strong>ignites</strong>
flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</p>
