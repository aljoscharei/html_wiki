<p>You have trained extensively in close-in spontaneous combat. You gain
a number of Skirmish dice (d6s) equal to your proficiency bonus. When it
is your turn, if you are unarmed or are using an improvised weapon, you
can use a bonus action to add a Skirmish die to your attack roll or
damage roll. You regain any spent Skirmish dice when you take a short or
longer rest.</p>
