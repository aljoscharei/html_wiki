<p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>For the spell’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with
dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you
can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of
the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your
turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another
creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a
saving throw against this casting of
<strong><em>eyebite</em></strong>.<br />
- <strong>Asleep.</strong> The target falls <a
href="202202102013%205e%20Conditions%20Unconscious.html">202202102013 5e
Conditions Unconscious</a>. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if
another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.<br />
- <strong>Panicked.</strong> The target is <a
href="5e%20Conditions%20Frightened.html">5e Conditions Frightened</a> of
you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash
action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available
route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place
at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this
effect ends.<br />
- <strong>Sickened.</strong> The target has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another
Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.</p>
