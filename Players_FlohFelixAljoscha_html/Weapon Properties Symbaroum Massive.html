<h1 >Weapon Properties Symbaroum
Massive</h1>
<p>Massive. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack
rolls with massive weapons. A massive weaponâ€™s size and bulk make it too
large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. When rolling
damage for a massive weapon, roll the damage die twice and take the
better result. This applies only to the initial damage die, not any
bonus damage.</p>
