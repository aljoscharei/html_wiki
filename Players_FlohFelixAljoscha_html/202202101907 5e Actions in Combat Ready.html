Ready</h1>
<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. <strong>To do so, you can take the Ready
action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the
start of your next turn</strong>.</p>
<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your
reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that
trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.
Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move
away.”</p>
<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right
<strong>after</strong> the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>
<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy,
which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be
readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto
the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is
broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you
are concentrating on the <strong><em>web</em></strong> spell and ready
<strong><em>magic missile</em></strong>, your
<strong><em>web</em></strong> spell ends, and if you take damage before
you release <strong><em>magic missile</em></strong> with your reaction,
your concentration might be broken.</p>

<p><strong>Do you get to use the additional attack from the Extra Attack
feature as well when you Ready an Attack action?</strong></p>
<p>One of my players, a monk, decided to Ready an action as an earth
elemental was about to attack. The trigger was the elemental moving
within five feet of him. When this occurred, he took his Attack action,
and then proceeded to take the extra attack as well.</p>
<p>I was unsure at the time whether or not the extra attack would also
happen, and I haven’t had much luck figuring it out.</p>
<h2 >No</h2>
<p>The ‘Extra Attack’ feature is worded so you only benefit from it when
you attack in your turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on <strong>your turn</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reacting to something is not in your turn, it’s in the turn of the
triggering creature.</p>

https://blackcitadelrpg.com/ready-action-5e/ ### <strong>Best Uses of
the Ready Action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making an attack with the ready action to get the jump on your
opponent.</li>
<li>Moving away from your opponent if they move towards you.</li>
<li>Preparing a spell and holding its energy until the perfect moment to
cast it. </li>
<li>Helping your companions when they need it most.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to think about the Ready action in DnD 5e is to imagine
it as the two-part statement: If This Then That. <em>If</em> the goblin
opens the door, <em>then</em> I will shoot him with my bow. </p>
<p>The mechanics of using a Ready action are split into two steps.
First, you use an action to declare a trigger and how you will react to
it (the IF THIS part of the Ready action).</p>
<p>Then, if the trigger takes place you either take your reaction
immediately or forgo your reaction and do nothing (the THEN THAT part of
the Ready action).</p>
<p>To explain in more detail, let’s dive into the two steps of the Ready
action. </p>
<h3 ><strong>Step 1: Declaring a
Trigger</strong></h3>
<p>In your turn, you can take the Ready action by declaring a trigger.
Once again, a simple way to phrase this is ‘If This Then That’. </p>
<p>There are some additional rules to consider if you’re taking a Ready
action. First, the trigger must be a perceivable circumstance – in other
words, something that could happen and would also trigger your suggested
reaction. </p>
<p>Second, although the trigger can be anything, it makes sense for it
to be something your enemy or something else outside of your control
does.</p>
<p>There is always some risk attached to the Ready action – your
opponent might do something unexpected – but when used effectively the
Ready action will give you one up over your enemies. </p>
<p>Third, the Ready action cannot be done as a bonus action. You could,
however, take a bonus action before taking a Ready action so long as
that bonus action does not require you to have already taken an action
that round. </p>
<h3 ><strong>Step 2: Reacting to a
Trigger</strong></h3>
<p>The second part of the Ready action is the reaction. Once you’ve
declared your trigger, if the trigger happens at any point before your
next turn you can make your planned reaction.</p>
<p>You can also do nothing if you decide against your reaction between
declaring the trigger and when the trigger takes place. </p>
<p>As mentioned, there is always a chance that the trigger will not take
place. This is why it is important to use the Ready action when you feel
confident about the trigger happening, otherwise, you have wasted an
action.</p>
<p>That said, there is always some risk – so if you’re new to using the
Ready action, it may take a while to get used to predict what the enemy
will do next. </p>
<h2 ><strong>Using the Ready Action
to Attack</strong></h2>
<p>The Ready action is great for turning an enemy action into a chance
for you to attack. The advantage of using the Ready action to attack is
that you can delay your attack until the opportune moment. </p>
<p>The rules for using the Ready action to attack are very simple –
simply declare your trigger (if the orc steps out of cover to attack I
shoot him) and then react to that trigger and make your attack. </p>
<p>When attacking using the Ready action, you will use your normal
range, damage, and so on.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You cannot use an <strong>extra attack</strong> in addition to the
attack you make as your reaction, even if you normally get an extra
attack.</li>
<li>You will not be able to use any other reaction that round, even if
you do not react to the trigger.</li>
</ol>
<h2 ><strong>Using the Ready Action
to Move</strong></h2>
<p>Another way to use the Ready action is to move (or any other
non-attack action like pulling a lever, ducking, or jumping). If the
trigger you declared takes place and you declared that you would move,
you can move at your usual base walking speed. </p>
<p>If you want to move more quickly, you could ready the Dash action
(<em>e.g. if the cultist moves towards me I Dash to the door</em>). This
will increase your speed but, as always, remember that a Ready action
consumes your action and your reaction in the next round, so it’s worth
deciding if it’s worth doing.</p>
<h2 ><strong>Using the Ready
Action to Cast Spells</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to use your Ready action for spellcasting, there are a
few more rules to bear in mind. The time spent in between declaring the
trigger and reacting to that trigger is time spent ‘holding onto the
spell’s magic’. This requires concentration, so any other spell you have
cast that also requires concentration will end. </p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary of the additional rules for using the Ready
action for spellcasting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spell you choose for your reaction must have a casting time of
one action.</li>
<li>Any spell that requires concentration will end when you take your
Ready action to prepare a different spell. </li>
<li>If your concentration is broken (e.g. you are damaged) before you
can react to the trigger, the spell is lost. </li>
<li><strong>DM’s Tip: There is no written rule for what happens if a
spell is readied but the trigger does not take place. The Ready action’s
reaction, however, must be taken before the start of your next turn. It
is down to the DM whether or not this spell could be cast as a separate
reaction or as an action in the next round.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 ><strong>Using the Ready Action
to Help</strong></h2>
<p>The <a
href="202202101905%205e%20Actions%20in%20Combat%20Help.html">202202101905
5e Actions in Combat Help</a> in DnD 5e is another useful action in
combat and can be combined with the Ready action since you can take any
action as your reaction to the trigger. </p>
<p>Once again, using the Help action as a Ready action is simple.
Declare your trigger – ‘if Dudley the Dwarf attacks the cultist I help
them to give them advantage’ – and if the trigger happens you can use a
reaction to do just that.</p>
<p>Readying a Help action is a great way to set your allies up for
strong attacks or distract enemies if they attack your weakened
companions.</p>
<h2 ><strong>Examples of the Ready
Action</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Readying a Melee Attack:</strong> For your action, you
declare “If the bandit steps within range, I attack him with my axe”.
The round ends and before your next turn, the bandit steps towards
you.</p>
<p>As a reaction, you make a melee attack with your axe. You can then
take your action as normal that round but you cannot take another
reaction. </p>
<p><strong>Readying a Ranged Attack:</strong> For your action, you
declare “If the Gnoll opens the door, I fire an arrow at him”. The
following round, the door opens as you predicted and you make a ranged
attack against the Gnoll as a reaction. </p>
<p><strong>Readying a Spell:</strong> You are being attacked by two
bandits. You are currently concentrating on a <em>charm</em> spell on
one of the bandits. For your action, you declare, “If the other bandit
moves towards one of my allies, I cast <em>hold person</em> on him”.</p>
<p>The <em>charm</em> spell immediately ends and you begin concentrating
on the <em>hold person</em> spell. So long as you hold your
concentration when the other bandit moves towards an ally you cast
<em>hold person</em> on them as a reaction, following the usual rules of
the spell. </p>
<p><strong>Readying a Help Action:</strong> You think your Warlock ally,
Wyla, is going to cast an important spell next round. For your action in
this round, you declare, “If Wyla the Warlock casts a spell next round,
I will help her so she has advantage on her ability check”.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Wyla casts her spell and thanks to you has advantage on
her ability check. You have used your reaction for that round but can
still take an action after Wyla has cast her spell.</p>
<h2 ><strong>The Ready
Action in Your Game: Tips for DMs</strong></h2>
<p>The Ready action gives you and your players lots of opportunities to
react to each other, enemies, and anything else happening within a
combat encounter. </p>
<p>Since the Ready action consumes both an action and a reaction, it’s
unlikely that players will overuse it. That said, you should encourage
them to remember it is an option as it can create some great moments in
combat. </p>
<p>When your player declares a trigger it is, of course, up to you as
the DM whether or not that trigger takes place (unless the trigger is
dependent on rolls or another PC).</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for you to reward players who are creative
with Ready actions but also cause the action to fail if you feel the
trigger is unlikely or you want the combat to be more difficult. </p>
<p>It’s possible that you will need to create some house rules for the
Ready action since the <em>DnD Basic Rules</em> don’t provide loads of
detail.</p>
<p><strong>Some house rules might include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you ready a spell and the trigger does not take place, you can
still cast that spell as your next action. </li>
<li>Alternatively: Your readied spell slot is lost if you don’t cast the
spell as your reaction before your next turn. </li>
<li>If you ready an attack, you can also make your extra attack on your
turn.</li>
</ul>
