<p>The caster releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that is
60’ long. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5’ wide, arcing and
jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5’ wide, for game purposes
treat it as if it is so. It deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per
caster level to each creature within its area. Any creature caught in
the area of effect receives a saving throw versus Blast. A successful
save reduces damage by half.</p>
<p>The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead,
gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing
barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the
barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the
barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the Judge’s
option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take
additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.</p>
