<h1 >Downtime Crafting</h1>
<p>erwähnt in xanathars guide to everything</p>
<p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and
works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object
you are trying to create (typically <a
href="Artisans%20tools.html">Artisans tools</a>). You might also need
access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For
example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to
craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>
<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or
more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must
expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you
want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress
every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the
item. For example, a suit of <a
href="5e%20Item%20Plate%20Armor%20AC%2018%20disadv%20on%20stealth%20str%20min%2015%2065%20lb.html">5e
Item Plate Armor AC 18 disadv on stealth str min 15 65 lb</a> (market
value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p>
<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of
a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with
the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each
character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping
to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in
100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>
<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to
pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal
cost.</p>
