<h1 >5e Social Interactions</h1>
<p>During a social interaction, the adventurers usually have a goal.
They want to extract information, secure aid, win someone’s trust,
escape punishment, avoid combat, negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever
other objective led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures
they interact with also have agendas.</p>
<p>Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a free-form
roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come into play. Other DMs prefer
to resolve the outcome of an interaction by having characters make
Charisma checks. Either approach works, and most games fall somewhere in
between, balancing player skill (roleplaying and persuading) with
character skill (reflected by ability checks).</p>
<h3 >Resolving Interactions</h3>
<p>The <a href="5e%20players%20handbook.html">5e players handbook</a> This
section adds to that material by providing a structured way to resolve a
social interaction. Much of this structure will be invisible to your
players in play and isn’t meant to be a substitute for roleplaying.</p>
<h4 >1. Starting Attitude</h4>
<p>Choose the starting attitude of a creature the adventurers are
interacting with: friendly, indifferent, or hostile.</p>
<p>A <strong>friendly</strong> creature wants to help the adventurers
and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions that require no
particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly creatures usually help
without question. If an element of personal risk is involved, a
successful Charisma check might be required to convince a friendly
creature to take that risk.</p>
<p>An <strong>indifferent</strong> creature might help or hinder the
party, depending on what the creature sees as most beneficial. A
creature’s indifference doesn’t necessarily make it standoffish or
disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be polite and genial, surly
and irritable, or anything in between. A successful Charisma check is
necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent creature
to do something.</p>
<p>A <strong>hostile</strong> creature opposes the adventurers and their
goals but doesn’t necessarily attack them on sight. For example, a
condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers
fail so as to keep them from becoming rivals for the king’s attention,
thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than direct threats and
violence. The adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging
Charisma checks to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their
behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward
the party that no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case
any attempt to sway it through diplomacy fails automatically.</p>
<h4 >2. Conversation</h4>
<p><strong>Play out the conversation.</strong> Let the adventurers make
their points, trying to frame their statements in terms that are
meaningful to the creature they are interacting with.</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing Attitude.</em></strong> The attitude of a
creature might change over the course of a conversation. If the
adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction (perhaps by
touching on a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile
creature temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature
temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful deed might
make a friendly creature temporarily indifferent or turn an indifferent
creature hostile.</p>
<p>Whether the adventurers can shift a creature’s attitude is up to you.
You decide whether the adventurers have successfully couched their
statements in terms that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature’s
attitude can’t shift more than one step during a single interaction,
whether temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p><strong><em>Determining Characteristics.</em></strong> The
adventurers don’t necessarily enter into a social interaction with a
full understanding of a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw. If they want to
shift a creature’s attitude by playing on these characteristics, they
first need to determine what the creature cares about. They can guess,
but doing so runs the risk of shifting the creature’s attitude in the
wrong direction if they guess badly.</p>
<p>After interacting with a creature long enough to get a sense of its
personality traits and characteristics through conversation, an
adventurer can attempt a Wisdom <a href="5e%20Skills%20Insight.html">5e
Skills Insight</a> check to uncover one of the creature’s
characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 10 or more might
misidentify a characteristic, so you should provide a false
characteristic or invert one of the creature’s existing characteristics.
For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the
uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check might be told that
the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the
downtrodden.</p>
<p>Given time, adventurers can also learn about a creature’s
characteristics from other sources, including its friends and allies,
personal letters, and publicly told stories. Acquiring such information
might be the basis of an entirely different set of social
interactions.</p>
<h4 >3. Charisma Check</h4>
<p>When the adventurers get to the point of their request, demand, or
suggestion — or if you decide the conversation has run its course — call
for a Charisma check. Any character who has actively participated in the
conversation can make the check. Depending on how the adventurers
handled the conversation, the <a href="5e%20Skills%20Persuasion.html">5e
Skills Persuasion</a> skill might apply to the check. The creature’s
current attitude determines the DC required to achieve a specific
reaction, as shown in the Conversation Reaction table.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aiding the Check.</em></strong> Other characters who make
substantial contributions to the conversation can help the character
making the check. If a helping character says or does something that
would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making
the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If the other character
inadvertently says something counterproductive or offensive, the
character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multiple Checks.</em></strong> Certain situations might
call for more than one check, particularly if the adventurers come into
the interaction with multiple goals.</p>
<h4 >4. Repeat?</h4>
<p>Once a Charisma check has been made, further attempts to influence
the target of the interaction might be fruitless or run the risk of
upsetting or angering the subject creature, potentially shifting its
attitude toward hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the
party’s rogue says something that pushes a noble’s attitude toward the
party from indifferent to hostile, another character might be able to
diffuse the noble’s hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful
Charisma <a href="5e%20Skills%20Persuasion.html">5e Skills Persuasion</a>
check.</p>
<h3 >Roleplaying</h3>
<p>For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn’t come
naturally for you, don’t worry. The main thing is for you to have fun
portraying your NPCs and monsters and to amuse your players in the
process. You don’t need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create
drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story elements and
characterizations that make your players laugh or feel emotionally
engaged and to incorporate those things into your roleplaying.</p>
<h4 >Being the NPC</h4>
<p><strong>Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life would
react to the adventurers</strong>. Consider what it cares about. Does it
have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By working such things into your
portrayal, you not only make the character or monster more believable,
but you also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a living
world.</p>
<p>Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists into the game.
For example, an old woman whose family was killed at the hands of an
evil wizard might regard the party’s wizard with grave suspicion.</p>
<p>However you roleplay a character or monster, the classic advice for
writers holds true: show, don’t tell. For example, rather than describe
an NPC as shallow and self-centered, have the individual act the way you
would expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The NPC might
have off-the-cuff answers for everything, an over-willingness to share
personal anecdotes, and a desperate need to make himself or herself the
subject of every conversation.</p>
<h4 >Using Your Voice</h4>
<p>Most of what you say during a session will be at a consistent level.
For dramatic effect, be ready to shout out a battle cry or speak in a
conspiratorial whisper.</p>
<p>Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices are memorable.
If you’re not a natural mimic or actor, borrowing distinctive speech
patterns from real life, the movies, or television is a good place to
start. Practice different voices and impersonations of famous people,
then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life.</p>
<p>Experiment with different speech patterns. For instance, a barmaid
and a city magistrate probably use their words differently. Similarly,
peasants could speak in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty
drawls. Let a pirate NPC say, “Arrrr, maties!” in your best Long John
Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar with Common stumble
along with awkward grammar. Let drunkards and monsters mutter with
slurred speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats.</p>
<p>In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure the adventurers
remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk to them, not so much to each other.
If possible, let one NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs
need to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know who’s
who.</p>
<h4 >Using Your Face and Arms</h4>
<p>Use your facial expressions to help show a character’s emotions.
Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your eyes — do whatever it takes
to make the character or monster memorable to the players. When you
combine facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character truly
comes to life.</p>
<p>Though you don’t need to stand up out of your chair, you can use your
arms to bring even more life to an NPC. A noble could chop the air with
one hand while speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage might
express her displeasure by silently rolling her eyes and massaging her
temples with her fingers.</p>
<h4 >Engaging the Players</h4>
<p>Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more than others.
Whatever your players’ tastes, your lively portrayal of NPCs and
monsters can inspire players to make just as much investment in
portraying their characters. This makes social interactions an
opportunity for everyone to become more immersed in the game, creating a
story whose protagonists have depth.</p>
<h5
>To
make sure everyone has something to do during a roleplaying-heavy game
session, consider one or more of the following approaches.</h5>
<p><strong><em>Appeal to Player Preferences.</em></strong> There are
in-game activities that players enjoy more than others, as discussed in
the <a href="5e%20DMG%20introduction.html">5e DMG introduction</a> .
Players who like acting thrive in interaction situations, and it’s fine
to let those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other
players by their example, but make sure those other players have an
opportunity to join in the fun.</p>
<p>Players who like exploring and storytelling are usually amenable to
roleplaying, as long as it moves the campaign forward and reveals more
about the world. Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring
out the right thing to say to shift an NPC’s attitude. Players who are
instigators like provoking reactions from NPCs, so they’re often easily
engaged — though not always productively.</p>
<p>Players who like to optimize their characters and slay monsters also
like to argue, and having conflict within an interaction can help those
players embrace roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an
extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending assassins to kill
the adventurers) is often the best way to keep action-focused players
engaged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Target Specific Characters.</em></strong> Create
situations where characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a
social interaction have to do at least some of the talking. Perhaps the
NPC in question is a family member or a contact of a particular
adventurer and talks only to that character. An NPC of a certain race or
class might listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with.
<strong>Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to get
specific players engaged</strong>, but don’t shut out players who are
already roleplaying.</p>
<p>If a couple of players are dominating the conversation, take a moment
now and then to involve the others. You can do this in character if you
like: “And what about your hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will
you pledge in exchange for my favor?” Or just ask the player what his or
her character is doing while the conversation is going on. The first
approach is better for players who are already comfortable speaking in
their characters’ voices. The second approach works better for players
who need encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario.</p>
