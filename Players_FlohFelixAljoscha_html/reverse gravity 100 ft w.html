<h1 >Reverse Gravity</h1>
<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 100 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a lodestone and iron
filings)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high
cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects
that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and
reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus
avoiding the fall.<br />
If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a
normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the
area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly,
for the duration.<br />
At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back
down. <a href="5e%20Falling.html">5e Falling</a></p>

Gravity an undervalued spell?</h1>
<p>“This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high

that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and
reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus
avoiding the fall” PHB pg.272.</p>
<p>So for an seventh level spell, it has an impressive effect but its
damage is underwhelming. If you have a high ceiling, you can remove
melee enemies from the fight and smash them with falling damage twice
(once when they go up, once when they come down) but it’s quite
situational and for a level 7 spell, it doesn’t compare that well to
many of the other things you could be doing with that spell slot.</p>
<p>That’s until you stop looking at it from a purely mechanical damaging
spell and focus on the first four words. “This spell reverses gravity”.
This isn’t just flavor text, it’s the effect of the spell. Casting this
on ANY building will result in it’s immediate destruction. Buildings
simply aren’t meant to be held upside down, they are designed with
gravity in mind. The entire structure of the house ‘collapses’ upwards.
Not just houses, but also walls, castles, keeps, gatehouses, bridges.
None of these structures are glued to the ground, they all rely on
gravity pressing them down into their foundations. Outside of magically
constructed buildings designed with this in mind, nothing is safe from
this spell. Most creatures trapped inside of these would be killed as
the rubble crushes them.</p>
<p>Have I interpreted the effects of this spell correctly and this spell
is a destructive beast or is there some part of architecture that I am
misunderstanding?</p>

<td>This is pretty transparently not how the spell is intended to work.
Without even considering the meaning of “objects not anchored in the
ground in some way”, let’s compare to <em>disintegrate</em>, a spell
that is only one spell level lower, and is a pretty classic
‘anti-materiel’ spell. Disintegrate, when striking a nonmagical Huge or
larger structure/object, disintegrates a 10-foot cube. Your suggested
interpretation would have <em>reverse gravity</em> reduce a column of
50-foot radius and 100-foot height to rubble. Quick math puts that at
78500 cubic feet, or 785 times more volume destroyed than
<em>disintegrate.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Further, in relation to the “spells do only what they say” vein,
note that <em>earthquake</em>, an 8th-level spell, specifically lists
its interactions with structures, and the mechanics/implications of
their destruction (50 damage per round to the structure, 5d6 damage with
Dex save to anything within half its height after reduced to 0). Not
only does your interpretation perform the effects of <em>earthquake</em>
quicker/instantly but it also insta-kills things inside? It has a
smaller effect radius than <em>earthquake</em>, but can target floating
structures as well so I’d say that’s a wash depending on your
setting.</td>

<tr>
<td>I’m all for using spells creatively to get more out of them, but
this is pretty clearly outside the intended power budget for this spell
(which is already pretty dang useful in a combat scenario).</td>

<p>You are forgetting the best use, ship combat, thats a fucking ton of
water and the ship will float up, drowning them as they reach the top
for a short time and flooding their boat, weapons and all sorts will
fall out before it falls down, a boat would take immense damage.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t the water flow outwards at the top thoughthough and fall
back down like a fountain once it reaches the edge of the cylinder? Come
to think of it, you could cast it next to their ship and it would suck
up all of their nearby water as it goes up the cylinder. The ship would
get sucked into it like an upside down maelstrom and then get launched
back out.</p>
<p>I mean there would still be 50ft of water going up and back down at
the top of the spell and if the boat is longer than the are then it will
tear the boat parts apart, especislly if damaged, any crew would have to
run to one part of the boat leaving them easy pray. What you said is
also true, you could cast into the water to make a huge drop for the
boat, this would for sure capsize it</p>
<p>It’s more likely that it would flip the boat or simply carry it up,
depending on the positioning of the boat within the spell. Think like a
hydraulic ram that they use in special effects to flip cars in
films.</p>
<p>Still a cool effect though!</p>
