<h1 >Razorvine</h1>
<p>Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also
clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A
10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has
AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic
damage.</p>
<p>When a creature comes into direct contact with razorvine for the
first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity
saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvineâ€™s
bladelike thorns.</p>
