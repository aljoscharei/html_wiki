<p>corruption</p>
<p>Power corrupts, and in Ruins of Symbaroum this is quite literally
true. A fundamental principle is that when nature is cultivated or
violated it grows dark and vengeful – and strikes back! The darkness
that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its
surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their
will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. This principle is
mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations
and the undead.</p>
<p>Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption
gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or
uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker.
However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking
up a pow- erful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption
Threshold.</p>
<p>For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the
total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as
the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose.
So the formula is:</p>
<p>Corruption Threshold = ([your proficiency bonus × 2] + your Charisma
modifier), minimum 2. <a href="charisma.html">charisma</a></p>
<p>During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption.
You might also start with a certain amount of permanent Corruption, due
to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting corruption value
can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.</p>
<p>If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your
Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you
can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less
than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold,
you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the <a
href="Mark%20of%20Corruption%20Table">Mark of Corruption Table</a>. The
mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your
Corruption Threshold.</p>
<p>example: Mira’s ogre mystic Grumpa has been casting sev- eral spells
in a desperate bid to escape some unwise hunters. Grumpa’s Corruption
Threshold is 7 and Mira’s last casting brings her current Corruption to
10. 10 (current Corruption) minus 7 (Corruption threshold) equals 3. She
rolls a d20 and if the result is 3 or lower, Grumpa will gain a mark of
Corruption.</p>
<p>You only make a roll when you gain new Corruption and that new
Corruption exceeds your Threshold. If you receive the same mark of
Corruption twice then it can either intensify or your GM can choose
another result for you.</p>
<p>Corruption and Shadow</p>
<p>As you gain Corruption, your Shadow changes. Temporary Corruption
darkens the Shadow, muting any color that it once possessed. The
category listing in the table below indicates how the theurgs of Prios
would judge a person’s Shadow, based on their holy smoke ritual (see
page 195). Permanent Corruption affects it in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent Corruption 1 point or more: Blight-stricken. Visible to
those who can see Shadows as black spots moving within the Shadow.</li>
<li>At half your Threshold or higher: Blight-marked. Your Shadow is
covered with darkness, causing great concern for those who can see
it.</li>
<li>Beyond your Threshold: Thoroughly Corrupt = Blight-Born. Your Shadow
becomes completely black and your character must become a NPC as you are
overwhelmed by the burdens you bear.</li>
</ul>
