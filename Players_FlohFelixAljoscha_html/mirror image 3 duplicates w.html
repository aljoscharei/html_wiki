<h1 >Mirror Image</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong> illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your
actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is
real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.<br />
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s
duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one
of your duplicates.<br />
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the
attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8
or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.<br />
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits
a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. <strong>A duplicate can be
destroyed only by an attack that hits it</strong>. It ignores all other
damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are
destroyed.<br />
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on
senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive
illusions as false, as with truesight.</p>

<p><a
href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/71245/what-counts-as-an-attack">Attacks
are <em>only</em> things that require an attack roll</a> (weapon attacks
and spell attacks). See P. 194 of the PHB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as
an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re
making an attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(“Attack” has a specific rules meaning in 5e that isn’t the same as
its ordinary English meaning; actions and spells that might be described
as <em>attacks</em> in ordinary language aren’t necessarily attacks as
far as the 5e rules are concerned.)</p>
<p>If a spell doesn’t say that the caster makes a spell attack, then
<em>mirror image</em> doesn’t interact with it. This is clear from the
complete spell description above: the spell effects only occur if the
caster is targeted with an attack, and its effects consist only of
changing the target of the attack to one of the duplicates. The only way
to determine if a duplicate is hit is by resolving the attack against
the duplicate’s AC. There is no provision for <em>mirror image</em>
interacting with spells that (for example) require the target to make a
saving throw.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the first paragraph, particularly the phrase
<em>it’s impossible to track which image is real</em>, establishes that
<em>mirror image</em> makes reliably targeting the caster with any
effect impossible. There are other spells that interfere with the
targeting of non-attack spells, and they spell out those effects
specifically:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/nondetection"><em><strong>Nondetection</strong></em></a>
(PHB p.263):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic …</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field"><em><strong>Antimagic
field</strong></em></a> (PHB p.213):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm
person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <em>mirror image</em> affected the targeting of non-attack spells,
we would expect there to be a specific clause in the description that
spells that interaction out. For example, something beginning with “When
a creature targets you with a non-attack spell …”. But there is no such
wording; the effects described apply only to attacks.</p>
<p>It might also be argued that <em>mirror image</em> clearly creates
illusions which are valid targets for spells, so a hostile spellcaster
might target one of these illusions by accident.</p>
<p>However, <em>mirror image</em> doesn’t create <em>illusions</em>; it
creates <em>illusory duplicates</em>, and it specifically spells out all
of their effects. Spells that create illusions (such as <em>major
image</em> or <em>minor illusion</em>) have different effects (and they
don’t specify what happens if they are targeted by a spell, attack or
otherwise).</p>
<p>So, to consider the two spells in the question:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blight"><em><strong>Blight</strong></em></a>
(PHB p.219):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can
see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. <strong>The
target must make a Constitution saving throw</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile"><em><strong>Magic
missile</strong></em></a> (PHB p.257):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart
<strong>hits a creature</strong> of your choice that you can see within
range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphases mine).</p>
<p><em>Magic missile</em> just hits the actual creature being affected
by <em>mirror image</em>, and doesn’t affect the images at all. It’s not
an attack, because no attack roll is made; it just does damage.
<em>Blight</em> likewise ignores the images and affects the target, as
it also is not an attack.</p>
