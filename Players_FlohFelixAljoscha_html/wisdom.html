<h1 >Wisdom</h1>
<p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and
represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>
<h2 >Wisdom Checks</h2>
<p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language,
understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the environment, or
care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine,
Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Wisdom checks.</p>
