<h3 >Activity While Traveling</h3>
<p>As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need
to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other
tasks to help the group’s journey.</p>
<h4 >Marching Order</h4>
<p>The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order
makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps,
which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to
those enemies when a fight breaks out.</p>
<p>A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or
the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room
to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too
tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a
middle rank.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fewer Than Three Ranks.</em></strong> If an adventuring
party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front
rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front
rank.</p>
<h4 >Stealth</h4>
<p>While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily.
As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by
other creatures they encounter. See the rules for <a
href="5e%20Hiding.html">5e Hiding</a> in chapter 7 <a

<p>SPLITTING UP THE PARTY</p>
<p>Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially
if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple
parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front,
middle, and back ranks.</p>
<p>The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into
several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that
a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to
sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A rogue and a
monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave
their dwarf fighter friend behind.</p>
<h4 >Noticing Threats</h4>
<p>Use the passive Wisdom <a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e
Skills Perception</a> scores of the characters to determine whether
anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For
example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might
decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear
or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the
front and middle ranks cannot.</p>
<p>While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their
passive Wisdom <a href="5e%20Skills%20Perception.html">5e Skills
Perception</a> scores to notice hidden threats.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encountering Creatures.</strong></em> If the DM
determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re
traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either
group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait
to see what the other group does.</p>
<p><em><strong>Surprising Foes.</strong></em> If the adventurers
encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the
adventurers or their foes might be surprised <a
href="5e%20Surprise.html">5e Surprise</a> when combat erupts. See <a
href="5e%20PHB%20Ch%2009%20Combat.html">5e PHB Ch 09 Combat</a> for more
about surprise.</p>
<h4 >Other Activities</h4>
<p>compare <a href="watch%20actions">watch actions</a></p>
<p>Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group
travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t
contribute their passive Wisdom (<a

scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a
character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities
instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.</p>
<p><strong><em>Navigate.</em></strong> The character can try to prevent
the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (<a

<p><strong><em>Draw a Map.</em></strong> The character can draw a map
that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on
course if they get lost. No ability check is required.</p>
<p><strong><em>Track.</em></strong> A character can follow the tracks of
another creature, making a Wisdom (<a

<p><strong><em>Forage.</em></strong> The character can keep an eye out
for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (<a
