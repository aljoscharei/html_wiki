<h2 >Vanilla 5e</h2>
<p>A character needs <strong>one pound of food per day</strong> and can
make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound
of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>
<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his
or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond
that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A
normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>
<h2 >symbaroum:</h2>
<p>For people traveling through Davokar, running out of food or water is
as serious a threat as predators and corrupted nature. After five days
without any food whatsoever, two days without water, or <strong>ten days
on rations</strong>, the following effects kick in: - For each
additional day, the character gains a level of exhaustion. - The
character cannot begin to recover exhaustion until they take a long rest
and also eat and drink something</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Food</strong>: Small or Medium creatures require 1 ration of
food per day. They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 +
their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before suffering 1 exhaustion
level per day thereafter. A normal day of eating resets the count of
days without food to zero.</p>
<p>A creature on half rations counts as going a ½ day without food (and
these half days accumulate until they can eat full rations).</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong>: Small or Medium creatures require 1 gallon of
water per day, or twice that in hot weather. A creature on a half ration
of water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution check at the end of each
day or suffer a level of exhaustion. If they drink less water than that,
they suffer a level of exhaustion automatically. If the character
already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two
levels instead of one level in either case.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery</strong>: Any exhaustion suffered from lack of food
or water cannot be removed until after a full day of normal
consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Large &amp; Tiny Creatures</strong>: Tiny creatures require
one-quarter ration of food and water per day. Large creatures (like
horses) require four rations  of food and water per day.</p>
