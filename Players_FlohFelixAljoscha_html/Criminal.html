<p>You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law.
You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have
contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most
people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the
underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by
flouting the rules and regulations of society.</p>

Criminal Contact</h4>
<p>You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison
to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and
from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the
local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can
deliver messages for you.</p>

Characteristics</h4>
<p>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them
are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if
not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but
criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.</p>

Criminal: Spy</h4>
<p>Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a
burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different
context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially
sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you
uncovered to the highest bidder.</p>
