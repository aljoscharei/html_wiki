<h1 >Forcecage</h1>
<p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 100 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The
prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.<br />
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is
made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the
shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier
that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells
cast into or out from the area.<br />
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the
cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or
those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center
of the area until they are completely outside the area.<br />
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the
creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the
cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.<br />
This spell can’t be dispelled by <a

<p>Sometimes the best solution is procrastination; well, not really, but
for those of you like me out there who want this to be true, there is
Forcecage. Stick your problems in a box and deal with the consequences
later!</p>
<p>Forcecage is bananas. It doesn’t require concentration, lasts an
hour, imposes exactly zero saving throws to work, and modally can trap
up to some huge creatures. It’s like if <a
href="https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/polymorph">Polymorph</a>
turned something into a box, but that box lasted an hour and was
indestructible. And the target can’t make a save against it.</p>
<p>The only instances where the spell falters is when you’re dealing
with massive enemies who can’t fit in either mode, or large enough
enemies with access to ample ranged options to pepper you from the
confines of the indestructible bird cage. If it’s Large or smaller,
though, you can just stick them in a box for an hour and go about your
business.</p>
<p>Each mode specifically does have moments to shine. While the box is
more often better as it deals with the bulk of magical enemies, the cage
works great if you’re looking to trap a huge melee beast. Once it’s in
there, you can stand back and fire off <a
href="5e%20spells%20fire%20bolt%201d10%20dmg%20w.html">5e spells fire bolt
1d10 dmg w</a> until it’s dead. It can’t go anywhere, the cage is
literally indestructible. More often you’ll find sticking the enemy
shaman or wizard into the box will turn off all magical aid the big
monster had, assuming you don’t just stick the big bad in the box until
all the little monsters are dealt with.</p>
<p>A neat trick you can do with Forcecage is stick something inside the
cage BEFORE you cast it. For example, if one character creates a <a
href="cloud%20of%20daggers.html">cloud of daggers</a> in the space of a
creature, then the other Forcecages that creature with the Cloud of
Daggers, now you have one very cramped space full of whirling spinning
knives and a single entity who physically can’t leave.</p>
<p>Not only is Forcecage excellent at removing enemies, it can be a neat
trick to pull out protectively. Consider you’re being overwhelmed by
zombies; stick the four members of your group in an indestructible
bubble and give the cleric time to cast <a
href="forbiddance%20ward%20area%20against%20planar%20travel%20and%20dmg%20certain%20type%20c.html">forbiddance
ward area against planar travel and dmg certain type c</a> !</p>
<p>If you’ve got 1,500 gold to spare (and at 13th level you should have
a fair bit of coin) Forcecage will deliver. It’s both flexible and
powerful; you rarely will feel you wasted the slot, because at minimum
you’re getting an enemy’s teleport out of it, where at maximum the spell
is warping encounters without even requiring saves.</p>
