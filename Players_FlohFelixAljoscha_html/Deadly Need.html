<h1 >Deadly Need</h1>
<p>Starting at 6th level you have learned enough of the sorcerous arts
that, if pressed, you can cast a spell at need. You can cast one of the
spells you know as a non-ritual spell but you gain twice the normal
Corruption since your understanding of the magical arts is limited.</p>
