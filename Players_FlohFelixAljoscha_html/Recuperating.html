<h1 >Recuperating</h1>
<p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a
debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>
<p>After <strong>three days</strong> of downtime spent recuperating, you
can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you
can choose <strong>one</strong> of the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit
points.</li>
<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one
disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>
</ul>
