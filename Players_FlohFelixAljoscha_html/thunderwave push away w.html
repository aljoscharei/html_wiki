Wizard Spells</a> # Thunderwave <em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cube)<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10
feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage and isn’t pushed.<br />
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of
effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s
effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300
feet.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 1st.</p>
