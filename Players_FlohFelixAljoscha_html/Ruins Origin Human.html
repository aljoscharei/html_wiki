<h1 >Ruins Origin Human</h1>
<p>According to the scholars of Ordo Magica, the people of Ambria and
Davokar are descendants of the same tribe, although the barbarians and
the Queen’s Folk hardly consider themselves so closely related. Queen
Korinthia’s claim to Ambria, the land south of Davokar forest, is
motivated by her ancestral connection to the region, and even the most
novice of Ambrian linguists can explain in what ways the “gibbering
speech of the barbarians and the melodious tongue of the Queen’s Folk
are similar.” More disputed are claims saying that the two peoples
originate from the same stem, rooted in the old and long forgotten
empire of Symbaroum whose ruins are hidden deep within Davokar.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, there are significant differences between the two
peoples in a cultural sense. The Ambrians abandoned their blighted
homeland Alberetor twenty years ago, to settle down in the
well-preserved ruins of Lindaros. On their journey they brought along
their architecture, knowledge, economic system and social hierarchies.
Thanks to its discipline the Ambrian army outmatches the barbarian clan
warriors when they meet in the open fields, but in the woods where the
skill of the individual becomes a decisive factor they are more evenly
matched. That, coupled with the advantage of having greater local
knowledge, has so far kept the Ambrians from entering very deep into the
forest – with the exception of treasure-hunters, religious fanatics
searching for lost sun temples and free settlers hoping to escape the
Queen’s control.</p>
<p>Since the days of old, the barbarians have been ruled by chieftains,
but enjoyed much greater independence and freedom compared to the
chastened crofters and peasants in the south. Nor do the barbarian
leaders seek to enforce a strict or rigid way of life upon their
subjects. The witches, the spiritual leaders among the barbarians, rule
with a light hand in the form of taboos and general rules – revere
nature, never abuse it and avoid the darker parts of the forest. The
clans lead their lives independent from one another, with the occasional
exception of skirmishes over resources in the border regions. By
tradition, the clan leaders answer to the High Chieftain on the plateau
of Karvosti, but he is in reality more of an arbitrator between feuding
clans than a strong ruler. However, the High Chieftain is expected to
lead the united barbarians to repel any invaders, particularly the
Ambrians, if it ever comes to open war.</p>
<p>This possibility,a united barbarian resistance commanded by the High
Chieftain, gives the Queen and her advisors nightmares, and would
explain why the Ambrians officially are so cautious regarding Davokar.
Since the battle in Year 10, when Korinthia’s troops attacked and
destroyed Haloban and his Jezites, only the Templars serving the Sun
Church have made any outright attacks against barbarian settlements.
Most infamous is their assault on Karvosti in Year 16 when they
attempted to seize the plateau with force of arms – an attempt which
ended in a discouraging defeat.</p>

Ambrian Names - Female Ambrian names usually end with –a while the male
names end with –o, but there are many exceptions since their native
kingdom was so extensive. One distinct exception is that the names of
most Ambrian male nobles end in –gai, –goi or –mei. The use of the
letter “x” is uncommon but exists and the letter “j” is replaced by the
letter “i” in almost every case. The vowels e and i are used frequently.
Save the nobles with their houses, the people of Ambria do not use
family names. However, especially remarkable or famous individuals can
be given a sort of honorary surname, related to that which makes them
noteworthy. A couple of examples are Lasifor Nightpitch, Mayor of
Thistle Hold, and the treasure-hunter Lysindra Goldengrasp.<br />

Barbarian Names - Just like the Ambrians, barbarian female names usually
end with –a, while male names tend to end with –mar, –mon or –mer. It is
customary that every other letter is a consonant and a vowel; double
vowels are common, while double consonants are almost never used. Like
the Ambrians, barbarians tend not to use the letter j, instead changing
it to y. The greatest difference between the two people is the
barbarians’ love for the vowels a, o and u. - <a
