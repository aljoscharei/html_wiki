<h1 >5e Moving Past Friends and
Foes</h1>
<p>You can move through friends. You can move through hostile creature’s
space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than
you (creature’s space treated as difcult terrain). Moving beyond foe’s
reach provokes opportunity attack unless disengaging.</p>
<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you
can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at
least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another
creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.</p>
<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end
your move in its space.</p>
<p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke
an <a href="5e%20Opportunity%20Attacks.html">5e Opportunity Attacks</a>,
as explained later in the chapter.</p>
