<h1 >Saving Throws</h1>
<p>A saving throw–also called a save–represents an attempt to resist a
spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t
normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
<p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity
saving throw.</p>
<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and
can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the
GM.</p>
<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The
wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect
that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a
spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency
bonus.</p>
<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>

<p>Lucy Blumire has one of the best treatments of the issue I think I’ve
seen: https://llblumire.co.uk/which-saving-throw-should-i-use/</p>
<p>TL;DR, the saving throws actually map pretty well onto different
kinds of effects as follows: - Death/Poison = instakill. - Wands/Rods =
avoiding an effect from an implement that you can see being aimed at
you. - Paralysis/Petrify = avoiding effects which try to move or alter
your entire body against your will (note that a save vs Petrify is
called for vs a collapsing ceiling in one of the examples, which only
makes sense in that contect). - Breath = avoiding an effect that fills a
large area volumetrically. - Spells = avoiding an effect that you can’t
see coming directly at you and/or magic.</p>
<p>The paradigm doesn’t <em>always</em> work (I’d argue fire ball really
should be a Breath save instead of Spells) but it’s a good guideline for
ad hoc rulings at least.</p>
