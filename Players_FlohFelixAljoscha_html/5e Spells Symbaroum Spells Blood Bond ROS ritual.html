<p>You magically link yourself to your familiar to an even greater
degree, allowing you to share the burden of Corruption between the two
of you. The familiar’s Corruption Threshold becomes equal to 2, plus any
positive Charisma modifier. When you receive temporary or permanent
Corruption you may direct all or part of it to your familiar.</p>
<p>If the familiar’s permanent Corruption becomes equal to or higher
than its Threshold, it becomes a blight-born (maybe spirit) creature and
abandons the caster, possibly attacking them as it escapes.</p>
