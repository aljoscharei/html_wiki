<h1 >Item Homunculus DC 17 20 Th
1</h1>
<p>A seed is planted and one day later a miniature servant sprouts from
the ground. The homunculus is Tiny, has no skills or features and all of
its ability scores are 10 (+0). It serves its maker loyally then withers
away after a month; all it leaves behind is a pile of dirt. Creating a
homunculus is a true violation of the natural order, meaning that the
one using the seed suffers 1d6 temporary Corruption.</p>
