<h1 >Item Crows Beak d8 3 lb</h1>
<p>Crow’s Beak. A less elegant, but still effective weapon is</p>
<p>the crow’s beak, also known as a Kandorian war pick af- ter the city
in Alberetor where it was first forged. The crow’s beak is a club whose
metal head is fitted with a spike or a beak of steel, in order to punch
through armor more easily. After the escape to Yndaros, the smiths of
the Kandorian war pick settled down in the district of Old Kadizar where
they have continued to craft their dreaded weapons.</p>
