<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of
opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube
that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The
spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss
it.<br />
When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell
provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded
area.</li>
<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing
vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>
<li>Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the
protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>
<li>Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.</li>
<li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
<li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this
effect permanent.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube
by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a
cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th
level.</p>
