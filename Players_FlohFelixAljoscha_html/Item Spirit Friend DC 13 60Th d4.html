<h1 >Item Spirit Friend DC 13 60Th
d4</h1>
<p>The miraculous drug called Spirit Friend is cooked in a cauldron, but
it is not the liquid that is bot- tled, but the vapors. The gray-white
smoke is captured in small ceramic jars and inhaled when needed. Spirit
Friend shifts the user into the ethereal for 1d4 turns, to the price of
as many points in temporary Corruption.</p>
