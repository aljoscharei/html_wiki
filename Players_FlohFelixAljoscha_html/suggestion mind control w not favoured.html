<h1 >Suggestion</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear
and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this
effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,
throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
harmful act ends the spell.<br />
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues
the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.<br />
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give
her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met
before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.<br />
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
<p>The target does not know a spell was cast: <a
href="casting%20a%20spell.md#Targets"></a>. BUT: Unless you have the <a
href="sorcerer#Subtle%20Spell"></a> feature, the target will remember
the muttering arcene ullulations even if the actions still appear
reasonable. Surrounding enemies will tell the target that it was the
caster who suggested a weird course of action. <a

<li><strong>Is the sentence of suggestion in the suggestion spell the
verbal component, or is the verbal component separate?</strong> Verbal
components are mystic words (<a href="5e%20players%20handbook.html">5e
players handbook</a>, 203), not normal speech. <a
href="casting%20a%20spell.md#Verbal%20(V)"></a> The spell’s suggestion
is an intelligible utterance that is separate from the verbal component.
The command spell is the simplest example of this principle. The
utterance of the verbal component is separate from, and precedes, any
verbal utterance that would bring about the spell’s effect.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>If a sorcerer casts a spell with only verbal or somatic
components using Subtle Spell, can an opponent use counterspell against
it?</strong> If a spell that’s altered by Subtle Spell has no material
component, then it’s impossible for anyone to perceive the spell being
cast. So, since you can’t see the casting, counterspell is of no
use.</li>
