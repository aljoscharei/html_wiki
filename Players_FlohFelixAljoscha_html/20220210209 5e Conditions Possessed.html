<h1 >20220210209 5e Conditions Possessed</h1>
<p><a href="Ghost#%5E8d6295"></a> &gt; <strong>Possession (Recharge
6).</strong> One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it
must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the
ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and
loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t
deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any
attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it
retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to
being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s
statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class
features, or proficiencies.<br />
&gt; The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the
ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by
an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends,
the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after
succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. ^8d6295</p>
