<h1 >5e Flanking</h1>
<p><a href="Ruins%20GM%20Index">Ruins GM Index</a></p>
<p>If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives combatants a simple
way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a common enemy.</p>
<p>A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also
can’t flank while it is <a

5e Conditions Incapacitated</a> . A Large or larger creature is flanking
as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for
flanking. <img src="squares_dmg.png" alt="squares_dmg.png" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Flanking on Squares.</em></strong> When a creature and at
least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides
or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them
has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.</p>
<p>When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid,
trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures’ spaces. If
the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space,
the enemy is flanked.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flanking on Hexes.</em></strong> When a creature and at
least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides
of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has
advantage on attack rolls against that enemy. On hexes, count around the
enemy from one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller
creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between them. Against a
Large creature, the allies flank if there are 4 hexes between them.
Against a Huge creature, they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a
Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes between them.</p>

<h4 >Optional Rule: Diagonals</h4>
<p>The <a
href="201810162210%205e%20Player&#39;s%20Handbook">201810162210 5e
Player’s Handbook</a> presents a simple method for counting movement and
measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you’re
moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of
geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule
provides more realism, but it requires more effort during combat.</p>
<p>When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first
diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts
as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever
you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically
between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character
might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight
(15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total
movement of 30 feet.</p>
<p>ranged Attacks dont benefit from flanking. - <a

Flanking Rule Why Many DMs Hate It and Why Ill Still Use It.pdf</a> -
The clear implication is that flanking only comes into play when using
miniatures on a battlemat. If you’re playing “theater of the mind,”
there’s no way to adjudicate flanking, so the rule doesn’t apply and the
advantage can’t be claimed. - You can’t use flanking advantage to negate
disadvantage from attacking an unseen enemy. - “A creature can’t flank
while it’s incapacitated” seems like a silly rule, since you can’t
<em>attack</em> if you’re incapacitated, but the important implication
is that your <em>ally</em> also has to be capable of taking actions to
divide your enemy’s attention. Otherwise, your ally isn’t helping you
flank—he or she is merely turning one space into difficult terrain. -
It’s not enough to attack an enemy from the <em>side</em> for flanking
advantage to apply: you must attack from <em>behind</em>. (I’m imputing
a concept of facing that technically doesn’t exist in D&amp;D 5E, but
you know what I mean.) The four-hex gap for Large creatures on a hex map
is odd, because four hexes around in one direction is only three in the
other. I’m not sure why the authors didn’t just go with three. -
Flanking applies to melee attackers only. I assume this is because
fending off a melee combatant is a very <em>active</em> process, whereas
whether a ranged attack hits you or not depends much more on your
attacker than it does on you. (The hex-map rule omits the specific
mention of melee attacks, and this omission isn’t corrected in the
<em>DMG</em> errata, but I assume it still holds. It’s certainly implied
by the adjacency requirement, and as a dungeon master, I wouldn’t allow
a player to argue that he or she could use the advantage gained from
flanking to negate the disadvantage from shooting at point-blank range.)
