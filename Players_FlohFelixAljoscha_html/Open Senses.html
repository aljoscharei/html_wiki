<h1 >Open Senses</h1>
<p>Ever since you finished your ‘maturation’, you have noticed that you
see more, hear more and sense more than your old human family and
friends. When you make a Wisdom (Insight or Perception) check you can
focus your senses and give yourself advantage on the check. Once you do
this, you must take a short or longer rest before using this feature
again.</p>
