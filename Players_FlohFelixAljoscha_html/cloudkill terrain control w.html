<p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog
centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around
corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the
fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured. <a

creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The
creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold
their breath or don’t need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from
you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the
ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of
the land, even pouring down openings.</p>

#### Cloudkill: <a href="cloudkill%20terrain%20control%20w.html">cloudkill
terrain control w</a> This spell creates a cloud of poison in a hex
adjacent to the caster. The cloud slowly moves away from the caster;
roll 1d6 during the caster’s command phase each round, and on a roll of
1-2, the cloud moves 1 hex. Any unit or character struck by cloudkill
must make a saving throw versus Poison each combat round it is in the
cloud. If it fails, it is destroyed. Even if the unit or character
survives, it must retreat (p. 23) from the hex towards its own map edge.
A unit or character which cannot retreat from the hex is destroyed.
Units and officers of more than 5 HD are immune to cloudkill. The spell
lasts the duration of the battle or until dispelled.</p>
<p><a href="ACKS%20Chapter%2005%20Spells#Cloudkill"></a> | Range: |
special | :——– | :———— | Arcane | 5 | Duration: | 6 turns</p>
<p>This spell creates a cloud of poison gas 30’ in diameter that spreads
out from the caster’s fingertips. The cloud moves at a rate of 20’ per
round away from the caster. The poison gas is heavier than air and will
sink down holes or slide downhill; it is broken up by trees or thick
vegetation. Each round they are within the cloud, creatures of fewer
than 5 Hit Dice or levels must save versus Poison or die, taking 1 point
of damage even if the save is successful. Creatures having 5 or more Hit
Dice or levels take 1 point of damage each round they are within the
cloud. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster
ceases to concentrate upon it.</p>

<strong>Duration:</strong> 6 turns</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30’</p>
<p>A poisonous fog streams from the caster’s fingertips, filling a 30’
diameter area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement:</strong> The fog moves at 60’ per turn (20’ per
round), driven by the wind (or away from the caster, in still
conditions).</li>
<li><strong>Sinking:</strong> Because the fog is heavier than air, it
sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole
openings.</li>
<li><strong>Damage:</strong> All creatures in contact with the vapours
suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact.</li>
<li><strong>Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice:</strong> Must also save
versus death (once per round of contact) or die.</li>
</ul>
