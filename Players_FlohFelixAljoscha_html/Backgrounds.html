<h1 >Backgrounds</h1>
<p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals
where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
jester.</p>
<p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about
your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your
background is <strong>what changed</strong>? Why did you stop doing
whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you
get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a
wealthy background, why don’t you have <strong>more</strong> money? How
did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from
ordinary people who share your background?</p>
<p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits
(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying
suggestions.</p>
<h3 >Proficiencies</h3>
<p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills.</p>
<p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one
or more tools.</p>
<p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
(skill or tool) instead.</p>
<h3 >Languages</h3>
<p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
beyond those given by race.</p>
<h3 >Equipment</h3>
<p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use
the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.</p>
<h3 >Suggested Characteristics</h3>
<p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on
your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine
them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics
of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might want to tweak
some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or
the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one
feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of
two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can
either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on
gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you
can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.)
Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one
flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background,
work with your GM to create one.</p>

<p>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: BACKGROUNDS</p>
<p>Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as
street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid didn’t really change
her, so she might choose the <a
