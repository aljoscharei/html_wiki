This spell blasts one unit in a hex adjacent to the caster. The damage
from burning hands is equal to the caster’s level -1, with a minimum of
1 point and a maximum of 4 points. Damage is doubled against cavalry
units (p. 83), behemoth cavalry units (p. 86), or chariot units (p. 89).
If the unit makes a successful saving throw versus Blast, damage is
reduced to half. A unit may never lose more than 1/8 its maximum uhp
(rounded up) from burning hands.</p>
