<h1 >Ruins Origin Goblin</h1>
<p>LittLe is known about the origin of goblins, but their presence in
the southern outskirts of Davokar is quite ob- vious. The tribe that
left the darkness of Davokar to settle down close to Thistle Hold swarms
and makes such a racket that they have made themselves quite unpopular
among the town’s human populace. Their fiery temperament and strange
ways of socializing have contributed to the disapproval: “Hide the
Boot”, “Tame the Ogre”, “Trim the Thistle”, “Tighten the Temple” and
“Want a Smack, Molok?” are party games that outsiders are reluctant to
even watch.</p>
<p>The life of a goblin is short – a goblin is considered a youngster at
the age of five, adult at ten and an elder at the age of twenty. To meet
a thirty-year-old goblin is a rarity, as most of them voluntarily return
to seek a lonesome death in Davokar before then. Meeting one who is
forty is all but unheard of. The truth of the goblin life-cycle is even
more remarkable, though few humans know it – when goblins feel the pull
of the forest not all of them die. Some are changed, becoming trolls or
ogres.</p>
<p>The only reason why goblins are tolerated in Thistle Hold is that
they are practical when it comes to doing dirty work like draining
marshes, emptying latrines and flailing about on scaffolding. Thanks to
that, a gibbering horde of sinewy goblins flows into the town every
morning to work hard at a number of heavy, dangerous or thankless tasks.
Come nightfall, they are once again driven away, and a bunch of
uncharacteristically silent goblins march back to their beds in simple
huts of straw and clay.</p>
<p>Some goblins stray from this pattern, mainly treasure-hunters and
goblins employed in the households of wealthy individuals in Thistle
Hold. A dozen or so goblin younglings can also be found in the convent
school in the capital city, where a handful of extremely patient monks
have committed themselves to saving whatever soul resides inside the
wild whelps. The most renowned goblin to represent both of these
phenomena is Garm Wormwriggler, brought up at the convent school to
later become a successful treasure-hunter.</p>
