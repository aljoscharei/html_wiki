<p>Suggested Characteristics</p>
<p>You are naturally attracted to the forces of magic and feel like it
is almost a personal concern for yourself. However, it is difficult to
give voice to these feelings, especially as everything seems at once new
and old to you…</p>
<p>Personality 1. Magic is the most wonderful thing in the world,
regardless of Corruption. 2. Corruption makes me nauseous, but I can
handle it. 3. I don’t say it if I can sing it. 4. I take myself very
seriously and hope this means others will too. 5. Magic scares me, but
I’m good at it, so what can I do? 6. I try to sound more lore-wise than
I am. 7. I enjoy simple pleasures in life: food, drink, singing. 8. I am
most often found with my nose in a book.</p>
<p>Ideal 1. Balance. The great forces of existence - nature,
civilization and Corruption - exist in a delicate balance. It needs to
be preserved if we are all to live. 2. Protection. I am a part of the
mystic community, and I must defend it. 3. Civilization. Discipline
turns creativity to use and ideas to value. It is the most important
thing. 4. Self-discovery. Life is about finding out who you are, and how
you relate to the world. 5. Nature. From it we come, and to it we go.
It’s the most important thing. 6. Corruption. Grossly misunderstood,
what others call “darkness” I call a tool of great power. I keep this to
myself, and mumble about balance if asked about my opinion.</p>
<p>Bond 1. I have this staff, just a stick to me really, with these
feathers and carvings and color paints on it. I don’t know what it
means, but I keep it. 2. For the first time I have found somewhere I
belong; in magic, and with those that practice it. 3. I see myself as a
wayward troll, regardless of what other trolls say. 4. The witch that
found me walking mindlessly in the woods taught me how to live. 5.
Goblins make me laugh, I like them. 6. There are very few people that
mean anything to me; for those that do I would do anything.</p>
<p>Flaw 1. I like the taste of Corruption, it’s like black honey on my
tongue. 2. Most mystics are less competent than me, even highly regarded
ones. 3. I equate keeping secrets with being important; I trade them
only for more secrets. 4. I can’t stand Corruption, and refrain from
doing things that produce it if I can. 5. I still feel like that
lumbering oaf, wandering aimlessly through a darkening forest. 6.
Sometimes my anger gets the best of me, and I use magic recklessly.</p>
