<h1 >Etherealness</h1>
<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area
where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border
Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the
spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up
or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and
hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and
you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.<br />
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by
other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal
Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special
ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.<br />
You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane,
allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you
originated from.<br />
When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated
from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a
solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted
to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force
damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.<br />
This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal
Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer
Planes.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing
creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures
must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.</p>

<p>You step into the <a href="ethereal%20realm">ethereal realm</a>
between the <strong>real world and the Yonderworld</strong> NOT THE
SPIRIT WORLD, in the area where it overlaps with your position in the
real world. You remain in this border realm for the duration or until
you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move
in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs
an extra foot. You can see and hear the real world, but everything there
looks gray, and you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.</p>
<p>While ethereal, you can only affect and be affected by other
creatures in the ethereal realm. Creatures that are not ethereal can’t
perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special ability or
magic has given them the ability to do so.</p>
<p>You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t in the ethere- al
realm, allowing you to move through objects you perceive in the real
world.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, you immediately return to the real world in the
spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object
or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the
nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal
to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p>
<p>This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are in the
Yonderworld.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 8th level or higher,
you can target up to three willing creatures (in- cluding you) for each
level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you
cast the spell.</p>
