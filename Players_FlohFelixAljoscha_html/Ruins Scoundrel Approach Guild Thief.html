<h1 >Ruins Scoundrel Approach
Guild Thief</h1>
<p>The Guild Thief has a long, if not proud, tradition rooted in
Alberetor, a tradition that emerged stronger after the relocation to the
north. Each of Ambria’s towns has at least one Thieves’ Guild, larger
ones often have one based in each district or block.</p>
<p>Not just anyone is qualified to be a Guild Thief. Sure, pick-pockets
and simplistic thugs may prove to be suitable recruits but only the most
cunning and agile can hope to gain membership in the Guild. To strike
unnoticed and know who is untouchable are matters of principle to the
Guild Thief.</p>
