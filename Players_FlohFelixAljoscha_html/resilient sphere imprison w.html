<p><em>4th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br />
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear
crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large
size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for
the duration.<br />
Nothing–not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects–can pass
through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can
breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or
object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside
it.<br />
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature
or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push
against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the
creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by
other creatures.<br />
