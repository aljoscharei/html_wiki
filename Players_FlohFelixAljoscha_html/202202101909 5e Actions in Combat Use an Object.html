<h1 >202202101909 5e Actions in
Combat Use an Object</h1>
<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such
as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires
your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action
is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on
your turn.</p>
<p>Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this
chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing
weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The
only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your
characterâ€™s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores
in <a href="5e%20PHB%20Ch%2007%20Using%20Ability%20Scores.html">5e PHB Ch
07 Using Ability Scores</a> for inspiration as you improvise.</p>
<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the
DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you
need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>
