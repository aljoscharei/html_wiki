<h1 >5e Melee Attack Reach</h1>
<p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus
attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain
creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a
greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p>If a creature has 5 ft. reach it can still attack a creature 5 ft.
away. But <a href="5e%20Opportunity%20Attacks.html">5e Opportunity
Attacks</a> only trigger wen leaving reach. <a
