<h1 >Ruins Feats Burdens Dark
Secret</h1>
<p>â€¢ Bonus: +2 to Charisma<br />
You have some kind of dark secret, which threatens to de- stroy your
reputation and life if revealed. Maybe you were a member of a corrupted
cult, killed someone, or protected a murderer and never got caught.
Should the dark secret become publicly known, you have disadvantage on
Cha- risma checks whenever the other party knows (and cares) about the
secret. Once per adventure there is a risk that the secret will be
exposed; the character must make a DC 10 ability check, with the ability
chosen based on the circumstances. If failed, someone discovers a clue
which can lead to the truth. Maybe some kind of physical evidence
surfaces (a letter, for in- stance)? Is it a witness claiming to have
seen something or is the character talking in his sleep? Whether the
suspicious person is a non-player character or a character, you must lay
their curiosity to rest or suffer the consequences. This normally
requires an opposed Charisma (Deception) vs Wis- dom (Insight) check.
Note that a non-player character may want to extort, rather than expose,
the character.</p>
